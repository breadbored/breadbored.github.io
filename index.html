Please consider enabling it.\n            - Data is never shared with anyone except me, and is not used for any other purpose.\n        - Added support for Windows 11 camera sharing\n            - This allows you to use the capture card in OBS while also using it in the MKWorld Toolkit (see [Optional: How to stream with OBS (Windows 11)](#optional-how-to-stream-with-obs-windows-11) for instructions).\n        - Fixed a bug where all times would report negative if the game pauses\n        - Fixed a bug where auto-splits get triggered when the game is paused or the player falls off the track\n\n### Notes\n\nWhen I refer to Windows 11, I mean Windows 11 24H2 with the latest updates installed. There is a patch after 24H2 that adds the ability to use the camera in multiple applications at once, which is required for the MKWorld Toolkit to work with OBS.\n\n### Setup Instructions (Windows)\n\n- (Optional) If you want to stream MKWorld with OBS, you must download use Windows 11 (or Mac or Linux when I publish the releases for those platforms).\n    - You need this (for now) because Windows 10 doesn't support multiple applications using the same capture card at the same time, but Windows 11 has an option for it you can enable. I am trying to develop a built-in virtual camera for the toolkit for Windows Pre-11 users, but it is not ready yet.\n    - See [Optional: How to stream with OBS (Windows 11)](#optional-how-to-stream-with-obs-windows-11) for instructions on how to set this up.\n- Download the [Windows](https://github.com/breadbored/breadbored.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.2-alpha/MKWorld.Toolkit_0.0.2_x64-setup.exe) version of the MKWorld Toolkit.\n- Run the installer and follow the instructions.\n- Once installed, open MKWorld Toolkit.\n\n### How to choose a track\n\n- Click the top left menu button and select \"Split Management\" in the menu.\n- Choose the track you want to run, put in the times you want to compare against, and then click the save button at the very bottom of the screen.\n\n### (Optional) How to stream with OBS (Windows 11)\n\nYou must have OBS and Windows 11.\n\n#### Set up your capture card in Windows 11:\n\nInstructions with images can be found [here](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/enable-or-disable-multiple-apps-to-use-camera-in-windows-11.31199/).\n\n- Open Windows 11 Settings with `Win + I`.\n- Go to \"*_Bluetooth \u0026 devices_*\"\n- Click \"*_Cameras_*\"\n- Under *_Connected cameras_* , click on the capture card (e.g. \"MiraBox\") you want to change this setting for.\n- Click on the *_Edit_* button for *_Advanced camera options_*.\n- Turn `on` or `off` *_Allow multiple apps to use camera at the same time_* for what you want, and click on Apply.\n\n#### Set up OBS to use the capture card:\n\n- Open MKWorld Toolkit\n- Open OBS and add a new source.\n- Choose \"Video Capture Device\" and select the capture card as the device.\n- Add a webview source and set the URL to `http://localhost:2025/obs`.\n  - Set the size to 800x1080, or whatever size you want the speedrun split UI to be.\n- Arrange to flavor.\n\n### How to test the program for pre-release testing\n\n- Open the MKWorld Toolkit.\n- Once MKWorld Toolkit is opened, you can navigate to http://localhost:2025/obs in your web browser.\n    - You should now see the speedrun split UI.\n- In the MKWorld Toolkit, go to the \"Camera Capture\" tab if you are not already there.\n- Select your capture card and then click the \"Start Capture Card\" button.\n- Play a Time Trial!\n    - ***NOTE: If none of the following happens, refresh the http://localhost:2025/obs page in your web browser.***\n    - Once the timer in game is detected to be 0:00.000, the timer will reset.\n    - Once the race starts, the timer will start counting up.\n    - Once a lap is completed, the timer will stop and the splits will be updated.\n    - Once the race is completed, the timer will stop and the splits will be updated.\n    - The timer resets when you restart the race.\n\n## DISCLAIMER\n\nMKWorld Toolkit is in ALPHA. It was originally built for my own personal use on MacOS, and Windows is in an untested state.","categories":["mariokartworld"],"skeets":[]},{"title":"Fact Check Movies While Watching","date":"2024-10-16","slug":"fact-check-movies-while-watching","excerpt":"Have you ever watched a \"Based on a True Story\" movie and wondered how much of it was true?

Have you ever paused a movie to see how much of it actually happened? Have you heard that American Sniper was mostly fabricated and wanted to know which parts?\n\nAll of those apply to me, and aparently to David McCandless, Dr Stephanie Starling, Omid Kashan, and Karl Webster. They created a [Visualisation of the accuracy of movies \"based on a true story\"](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/). \n\nI felt inspired by their work, and I had an idea: What if we could see fact checking information while watching a movie?... Maybe a bit boring and intrusive to some, but I think this would be a fun feature for those who are interested in the truth behind the stories.\n\nBelow are the SRT files for the movies that have been fact checked by the great people I meantioned. I wrote a script to compile into subtitles to be used while watching a movie, and while this post isn't what I have this site for, I thought I'd share the result of a short project instead of the whole process. \n\n## Download the subtitles:\n\nThese subtitles are listed in alphabetical order. You can use these files with your favourite media player that supports SRT files, such as Plex, VLC, Kodi, etc.\n\n- [12 Years a Slave](/assets/factchecksrt/12_years_a_slave.srt)\n- [American Sniper](/assets/factchecksrt/american_sniper.srt)\n- [Bohemian Rhapsody](/assets/factchecksrt/bohemian_rhapsody.srt)\n- [Bridge of Spies](/assets/factchecksrt/bridge_of_spies.srt)\n- [Captain Phillips](/assets/factchecksrt/captain_phillips.srt)\n- [Dallas Buyers Club](/assets/factchecksrt/dallas_buyers_club.srt)\n- [Hacksaw Ridge](/assets/factchecksrt/hacksaw_ridge.srt)\n- [Hidden Figures](/assets/factchecksrt/hidden_figures.srt)\n- [Lion](/assets/factchecksrt/lion.srt)\n- [Philomena](/assets/factchecksrt/philomena.srt)\n- [Rush](/assets/factchecksrt/rush.srt)\n- [Selma](/assets/factchecksrt/selma.srt)\n- [Spotlight](/assets/factchecksrt/spotlight.srt)\n- [The Big Short](/assets/factchecksrt/the_big_short.srt)\n- [The Imitation Game](/assets/factchecksrt/the_imitation_game.srt)\n- [The King's Speech](/assets/factchecksrt/the_kings_speech.srt)\n- [The Social Network](/assets/factchecksrt/the_social_network.srt)\n- [The Wolf of Wall Street](/assets/factchecksrt/the_wolf_of_wall_street.srt)\n\n## I like this idea, can I submit a movie?\n\nSure! Email me at [brad@bread.codes](mailto:brad@bread.codes) and I'll send you a tempalte to fill out for your favorite movie, then once you send it back, I'll add it to the list above and credit you and your amazing work. Please include \"Fact Check Movie\" in the subject line!\n\n## Uh Oh, something's wrong with the subtitles, and it's not just my media player!\n\nIf you find an issue with the subtitles like misaligned text, please email me at [brad@bread.codes](mailto:brad@bread.codes) and I'll fix it as soon as possible. Please include \"Fact Check Movie\" in the subject line!\n\n## How to use the subtitles:\n\n1. Download the SRT file for the movie you want to watch.\n2. Open your movie in your favourite media player on your computer (or TV/phone/tablet if you are using Plex, VLC, Kodi).\n3. Load the SRT file while the movie is open if you are using VLC. If you are using Plex, you can include the subtitle in the same directory as the movie file, and Plex may automatically load it for you, if not you can choose it in the captions menu.\n4. Enjoy the movie with fact checking information!\n\n## Original Data Credits:\n\nAgain, thank you so much to David McCandless, Dr Stephanie Starling, Omid Kashan, and Karl Webster for their amazing work.
