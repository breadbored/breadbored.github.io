Are you a Music-Spreadsheet Wizard?

Do you like your `mod`s and `it`s more than your `wav`s and `mp3`s?

Are you a fan of the limit, as opposed to the limitless?

Today I am introducing a project I've had on my mind for almost a year called TrackPak. TrackPak is a tool that converts your tracker music to an album that runs entirely on the Game Boy Advance.

TrackPak supports several customization options such as fonts, color schemes, and additional details about you and your music.

## How does it work?

Through the magic of Duct Tape and Prayers™, it's really just two parts:

- A Butano `base/` project that handles the UI and music management
- an Express server that generates a C header for the `base/` project, and starts the `make` process

That's literally it. Due to it's simplicity, I'll be releasing a standalone tool as well in the near future along with the `base/` project that does all the foundational music and UI management.
