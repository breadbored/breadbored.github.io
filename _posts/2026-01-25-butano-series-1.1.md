## Editor FAQ

### I don't see error squiggles or IntelliSense in my C++ files

#### Visual Studio Code IntelliSense Setup

Make sure you have the C/C++ extension installed from Microsoft. You can find it in the Extensions Marketplace by searching for "C/C++".

(source: [Visual Studio Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp))

#### Zed Editor IntelliSense Setup

C/C++ IntelliSense is supported natively in Zed Editor. Ensure that your paths match your setup in the `.clangd` file.

The configuration I included in the `.clangd` file is for Linux and macOS. If you're using Windows, you may need to adjust the paths accordingly.
