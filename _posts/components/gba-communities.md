### Communities

#### Discord

- Please remember this is ***not my server***, so do not dominate the conversation with questions about this series. The topics are more broad than this series or even Butano itself, so please be respectful of that.
- If you need help, the thing that helps everyone involved is providing your full source code, or if you are unwilling to do that, a "Minimally Reproducible Example" that demonstrates your issue. Not only might you find your problem along the way, but this is a good practice in general when asking for help with programming.
- Please be respectful to @GValiente, the author of Butano, as well as other ***volunteers*** who are ***volunteering*** their time to help you. You are not entitled to their time or labor. I have had people break this rule ***many*** times in ***many*** projects. This is a hobby for everyone involved.
- Please search the channels for your question before asking it. Chances are, someone else has had the same question before you.
- Follow the server rules.
