Have you ever watched a "Based on a True Story" movie and wondered how much of it was true? I have, and aparently so did Karl Webster, David McCandless, Dr Stephanie Starling, and Omid Kashan. They created a [Visualisation of the accuracy of movies "based on a true story"](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/). If you're interested in the data, or their amazing visualization, I highly recommend you check it out. They even give you filters for your level of pedantry, and you can see the percentage of the movie that is true, true-ish, false-ish, false, has no records, etc along with sources.

I felt inspired by their work, and I had an idea: What if we could see fact checking information while watching a movie?... Maybe a bit boring to some, but I think this would be a fun feature for those who are interested in the truth behind their favorite stories.

Below are the SRT files for the movies that have been fact checked by the great people at Information is Beautiful, and compiled into subtitles by me. You can use these files with your favourite media player that supports SRT files, such as Plex, VLC, Kodi, etc.

## Download the subtitles:

## How to use the subtitles:

If you are using Plex, you can include the subtitle in the same directory as the movie file, and Plex will automatically load it for you. If it does not, you can manually load the subtitle in the bottom left captions menu.
