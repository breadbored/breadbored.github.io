No record of a Blandine-Bentham.
No Dr. Blandine-Bentham is mentioned in the records. Bertie did see several specialists to no avail, but it's unclear what methods they used on him.

13
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
TRUE
Bertie had seen several experts to no avail, & he wanted to give up. Elizabeth had a calming influence on the king, & was always with him during his speeches, offering support & encouragement. For Elizabeth's sake, he agreed to try again.

15
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:22,000
FALSE
Elizabeth didn't go to Harley Street in person. There are conflicting accounts of how Lionel ended up with Bertie as a client. One involves a royal equerry looking for a specialist, the other, a musical comedy starlett & client of Lionel's.

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
FALSE-ISH
While Elizabeth did not visit Lionel to arrange an appointment for Bertie, Lionel did insist to whoever it was that Bertie be brought to him. The idea was that journeying to his office would take effort, providing an additional reason to take the treatment seriously.

17
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:17,000
FALSE-ISH
Although there are various explanations for how Lionel came to be Bertie's speech therapist, in all of them he would have known who Bertie was from the start. He did insist that Bertie visit him in Harley St, until he became King & it was no longer plausible.

Bertie adored his children & was happy in the presence of his family. It's unclear if his speech suffered when around them.

Lionel was a trained actor, but the memoir doesn't suggest he continued down the acting path once he had set up as a speech therapist.
The Daily Telegraph

22
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,000
TRUE
Elizabeth did encourage Bertie to try one more doctor, & they did visit Harley Street together. The practice had stairs, though, not an elevator.

Lionel's notes from the first meeting don't suggest any anger on Bertie's part, although we know Bertie suffered enormous frustration over his speaking in general.

25
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:51,000

George famously said that he hoped nothing would come between Bertie & Lilibet (young Elizabeth) & the throne, especially not David. He thought Bertie to be the more mature & capable son.


29
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:53,000
TRUE
George was impatient with his son's stammering, taking a simple 'get it out!' approach. It has been suggested that George's harsh behaviour worsened or even caused the stammer in the first place.

TRUE-ISH
Edward VII utilised his own form of 'daylight saving', in which he set all the clocks at Sandringham half an hour early (rather than putting them forward as in the film) to allow for more hunting time in the evenings. This was known as 'S.T.', or 'Sandringham Time'.
The King's Speech (2010) by M. Logue & P. Conradi, p47

38
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:38,000
TRUE-ISH
Lang was a bit of a problem for the royal family, making post-abdication speeches about David's poor conduct, & announcing Bertie's speech impediment. Whether or not he was a suck up isn't clear, but as in the film, it seems he wasn't much liked.
The King's Speech (2010) by M. Logue & P. Conradi, p116-117

39
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:56,000
TRUE
The king died on Jan 15th 1936, at 11.55pm, when Lord Dawson administered a lethal injection of cocaine & morphine. His actions were in part to end the king's suffering, & in part to make sure the death met the morning papers & not the less-suitable evening papers.

40
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:13,000
FALSE
There is no record of David crying like this on his father's death, although it is known that Bertie cried on his mother's shoulder when David abdicated, making him king - possibly a ref. to that moment? Family & important others were around when King George V died.
The Daily Telegraph

41
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:43,000
TRUE-ISH
David was concerned about the impact of his position on his relationship with Wallis. Bertie tried to contact David during the crisis but was barely able to speak with him.

00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,000

TRUE
Wallis broke protocol during a party thrown at Balmoral, greeting Bertie & Elizabeth as if she, not David, were the host, offending Elizabeth.

We don't know what conversations happened between the brothers, or whether things got nasty between them. Bertie was certainly shocked by the prospect of becoming king, & hoped it wouldn't come to that.

01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Not in the memoir. No mention of fuckety-fuck.
The memoir suggests that Bertie improved continually, & no major relapses are noted. Bertie was frustrated & anxious about becoming king, but there is no mention of a swearing rant.
The King's Speech (2010) by M. Logue & P. Conradi

51
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:58,000
FALSE
The memoir suggests Bertie took a step back from his treatment while all this family drama was going on, & so Lionel was not involved. He was probably too deferent to suggest such things anyway. However, he was a supportive ear for Bertie when needed.

Wall St Journal

52
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:26,000
TRUE
David was intent on marrying Wallis & told Baldwin that if he couldn't marry her & remain king he would step down. It would have been acceptable for him to have Wallis as a mistress, but given she was a divorced woman & not aristocracy, marriage was not cool.

53
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
TRUE-ISH
Lionel was concerned about Bertie's. Lionel was generally quiet about his work with Bertie, but his wife knew about him & they met several times. His wife was supportive & they had a close marriage, Lionel likely spoke with her about his patients.

Churchill actually supported David & encouraged him to remain king. Albert Frederick Arthur George chose to become King George VI as a tribute to his father & a symbol of continuity, not as a result of Churchill suggesting it sounded too German.
