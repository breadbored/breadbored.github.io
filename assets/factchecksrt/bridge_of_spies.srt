TRUE-ISH
Abel's assistant fled to the US embassy in Paris, revealed his identity as a KGB agent & ratted ABEL out to the authorities, leading to Abel's capture by the FBI on 21 June 1957. They probably didn't literally follow him through the subway, though. 
6
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:36,000
TRUE-ISH
Abel was an artist & photographer. His photo shop was a cover for his spy gear, & travel could be explained by his urge to paint & photograph. The FBI probably weren't following him through the streets - they found him at an address given by his former assistant. 
7
00:05:36,000 --> 00:06:12,000
TRUE-ISH
A hollow nickel containing a coded note was used in evidence against Abel. It was lost by Abel's useless assistant Hayhanen, & found 7 months later by a newsboy, who turned it in. The bench bit isn't in the records, though.

18
00:25:26,000 --> 00:26:50,000
TRUE

23
00:33:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
TRUE
Donovan requested the case not go to trial since the FBI seemed not to have followed search-and-seizure protocol, thus violating Abel's constitutional rights & rendering evidence found in the search null. Byers denied the request.

TRUE
With the stack of evidence against him, Abel was never going to go free. While he was concerned about his future, Donovan recalls that in the 4yrs plus that he defended Abel, he only saw him anger once (when his correspondence privileges were revoked in jail). He was a calm man.

26
00:36:21,000 --> 00:37:45,000

This scene was inspired by real life, but Spielberg's, not Donovan's. Spielberg based the incident on memories from his own youth, when he spent a lot of time thinking about the end of the world.

00:42:39,000 --> 00:45:29,000
TRUE-ISH

34
00:48:37,000 --> 00:50:17,000

00:57:03,000 --> 00:59:48,000

The U-2 plane, which could get higher than 70,000ft, was thought to be out of range of missile attacks. It wasn't. The Russians shot it down. Powers wasn't able to engage the self-destruct switch before ejecting from the cockpit. 
46
00:59:48,000 --> 01:00:24,000
TRUE
Donovan was almost successful in his appeal. He was intially instructed to present his argument again in 7months' time. Ultimately, The Supreme Court only upheld it by a majority verdict of 5/4, which Abel heard of over the radio. He did paint in prison.

01:12:04,000 --> 01:14:28,000

68
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:50,000
TRUE

79
01:56:30,000 --> 01:58:09,000

86
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:56,000
TRUE-ISH
