Turing was already working for the government's Code and Cypher School before he started at Bletchley - so, it's not entirely impossible that he heard something. But Bletchley Park work was top secret, so it seems unlikely.

It's highly likely Bletchley Park was in possession of an Enigma machine at some point. But Polish intelligence did not steal one. They were in fact the first to break early Enigma code & built the first "bombe" cryptological machine in 1939.

23
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:58,000
More complicated than that. 
It was more complicated than that. There were several different Enigma machines of varying complexity. Some used a combination of electromagnetic cyphering (which the team could technically reverse engineer) & codebooks (which they needed to capture somehow).

People have questioned the calculations. Plus it's unclear whether Turing means 10 men each checking one setting per min, or 10 men together checking one setting per min.  Either way, it would have taken a very long time.

Polish intelligence built the first "Bombe" decryption machines in 1938. The Germans quickly increased the complexity of the Enigma machine & put the decryption beyond the reach of these early machines. Only the resource-rich English could develop the research.

Turing did not have such a confrontation with Denniston. However there was some reported tension at Bletchley between the discplined service chiefs & the "unorthodox' & "undiscplined" cypher teams. Turing in particular thrived on a lack of uniformity & rank.

Kinda true. Sometimes, the Allies had to engage in some subtle internal subterfuge to mask the use of such exact intelligence from their own people, in case those without appropriate clearance inferred the German codes had been cracked.
