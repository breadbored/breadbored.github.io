FALSE-ISH
Kyle did watch over the marines from a rooftop & he did radio the chief for clearance on certain shots, but he didn't report seeing anyone but a woman & a few children at this point. Still, he had his crosshairs on a lot of men over the course of his career. 
5
00:02:37,000 --> 00:03:34,000
FALSE-ISH
Kyle's first kill was a woman with a grenade. She did have a child with her initally, but was alone when she approached the convoy. Kyle never killed a child. 
6
00:03:34,000 --> 00:04:18,000
TRUE
Kyle's father, a church deacon, gave him his first real gun when he was 8 years old. He often took him out hunting. 
7
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:52,000
FALSE-ISH

8
00:04:52,000 --> 00:06:12,000
TRUE
Kyle's father always encouraged him & his brother to protect their own. Even as a kid Kyle was always fighting, usually to protect somebody else, often Jeff. 
9
00:06:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
TRUE
Kyle did compete in rodeos, his brother Jeff did too. They were inseparable, Jeff followed Kyle everywhere. He gave up broncos after an injury that left him with pins in his wrists. 
10
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:34,000
FALSE
Kyle did injure his hand badly in a rodeo fall, but the whole girlfriend scene was fabricated.

12

13
00:09:16,000 --> 00:10:15,000

14
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:47,000
TRUE
Originally Kyle wanted to be a marine, but when he turned up to the recruiting offices the marine guy was out for lunch. He spoke to the army guy but it didn't appeal much, then he spoke to the SEAL guy & was hooked instantly. 
15
00:10:47,000 --> 00:13:43,000
TRUE-ISH
The training was intense. They had to sit in freezing water for hours on end. Kyle suffered but he was determined. He didn't meet any of his future teammates during training, though. He got close with a guy called Marcus Luttrell but never fought together. 
16
00:13:43,000 --> 00:17:16,000
TRUE
They did meet in a bar. Taya was suspicious of Kyle at first - she thought military men were arrogant, & after her sister had been through a rough divorce with a SEAL hopeful she vowed to stay away. But they clicked & talked for hours. 
17
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:41,000
TRUE
Taya did puke as they walked out to the carpark. They'd had a lot of scotch between them.
18
00:17:41,000 --> 00:18:17,000
TRUE-ISH
Kyle was a pretty decent shooter at training, not the best, not the worst. He graduated middle of his class. His hunting experience had taught him how to get a bullet from A to B. His sniper training came much later, though.
19
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:57,000
TRUE
Kyle called Taya a lot. She rarely answered, so he left a lot of messages. She rarely called back. Eventually, though, she came around. 
20
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:22,000
TRUE-ISH
He had a bit of trouble with his sniper training at first. But his difficulties weren't because he was lovestruck. His sniper training was long after Taya & Kyle were married, & Kyle had been out on tours a few times already before he even begun sniper training. 
21
00:19:22,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We couldn't find a source for this.

22
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:52,000
TRUE-ISH

00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We couldn't find a source for this. 
Kyle doesn't mention this in his bio, but he was relatively private about his personal life. Presumably they had sex at some point...
24
00:21:33,000 --> 00:22:03,000
TRUE-ISH
There was a rattlesnake incident - Kyle encountered one in a field while on a mission & changed his course to avoid it. Kyle did practise his observation every chance he got, looking out into the woods for slight movements etc. This scene works as a composite. 
25
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:43,000
TRUE
Kyle was at Taya's place when the news hit. Taya did yell for Kyle, & they watched it all unravel on the TV. He was furious.
26
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
TRUE
Kyle did learn to hone his focus absolutely. 
27
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:38,000
TRUE-ISH
Just like in the movie there was no big proposal or anything, they were just talking & ended up getting engaged. But the conversation was in a car, not a bed, & Kyle wasn't 100% convinced of the idea like he's shown to be in the scene. 
28
00:23:38,000 --> 00:25:03,000
FALSE-ISH
Kyle & Taya married quickly because Kyle was due to head out on his first tour. They didn't find out America was going to war with Iraq during the wedding. His brother Jeff had joined the marines by then though, & was deployed soon after.
29
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:50,000
TRUE-ISH
Marine & SEAL teams rolled into Fallujah. The marines were there to clear buildings while the snipers watched out for them from rooftops. Kyle did keep a bible with him the whole time, although not one stolen from church as a kid. 
30
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:30,000
TRUE-ISH
They all headed out to their positions right away. Kyle mentions the guy he was paired with, says they got along fine. He doesn't use names for all the people involved since some of them are still in active duty. 
31
00:26:30,000 --> 00:28:28,000
FALSE-ISH
Kyle's first sniper kill was a woman with a grenade. She did have a child with her initally, but was alone when she approached the convoy. Kyle never killed a child. 
32
00:28:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
FALSE
Kyle never felt uneasy about any kill, & has said killing that woman was no different to killing any other enemy. He doesn't mention talking to Biggles about it, either. 
33
00:29:36,000 --> 00:30:07,000
TRUE-ISH
Kyle protected the marines from the rooftops. He killed a lot of insurgents on those days. He shot a guy right behind a patrol of marines, who had no idea who fired the shot & thought they were under attack. The dead guy didn't fall from the sky, though. 
34
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:52,000

37
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:44,000

38
00:33:44,000 --> 00:34:03,000
TRUE
While Kyle was assisting an army unit he shot a guy carrying an AK47. Although there were witnesses, the guy's wife said he had been carrying a Quran. There was an investigation, & Kyle was confined to base while they sorted it. He was cleared in the end. 
39
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:45,000
TRUE
Biggles & Kyle's other buddies all teased him about his legendary status. Dauber changed 'The Legend' to 'The Myth' to knock him down a few pegs. 
40
00:34:45,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We couldn't find a source for this. 
Jeff did join the military, but we don't know how Kyle felt about his deployment, & we don't know much about his conversations with Taya either. He was private about his feelings.
41
00:37:12,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Kyle didn't mention any specific enemy.
According to the bio they weren't looking for any one particular enemy, just trying to kill as many insurgents as they could find. Although there was a lot of classified stuff he wasn't allowed to include.
42
00:38:22,000 --> 00:39:05,000
TRUE-ISH
Kyle did want to join the marines on the ground, but it wasn't a problem.
43
00:39:05,000 --> 00:40:29,000
TRUE-ISH
A composite scene. Kyle didn't like cowards. One marine he was paired with ran away instead of covering him & really pissed him off. In a separate event, Kyle handed his sniper rifle over to the marine he was paired with & left him to join the marines on the ground. 
44
00:40:29,000 --> 00:42:13,000
FALSE-ISH

45
00:42:13,000 --> 00:43:59,000
FALSE
Kyle doesn't mention interrogating anybody. Although The Butcher might have been a real person, Kyle had nothing to do with him. His role in Kyle's story was fabricated. 
46

52
00:46:38,000 --> 00:47:58,000
FALSE-ISH
Kyle had no dealings with The Butcher & doesn't mention anything about an Al-Obedi. Taya did once hear a gunfight over the phone, when Kyle didn't realise he was still connected. Taya didn't hear from Kyle for 5 days after the incident, & thought he was dead. 
53
00:47:58,000 --> 00:49:48,000
FALSE-ISH
Abu Deraa, an Iraqi warlord also known as The Butcher, did use a drill to kill & torture his victims. A drill through the skull was his trademark. Kyle had no interaction with either The Butcher or Mustafa, though.
54
00:49:48,000 --> 00:50:35,000
FALSE-ISH
Kyle was confined to base following an investigation into one of his kills. It wasn't anything to do with The Butcher, though. He spent the time, he says, working out, playing video games & watching porn.

TRUE
Kyle was always frustrated & uneasy when on leave. He was jumpy & sensitive to noise. The first week of any time off he didn't want to leave the house.
59
00:53:60,000 --> 00:54:55,000
TRUE-ISH
They stuck two unrelated bits of story together here. Kyle did start suffering with extreme high blood pressure, & sought medical attention while on deployment, but Taya had long since given birth to both children by the time Kyle starting having health problems.
60
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:45,000
FALSE-ISH
Kyle was always pissed off that whenever he came home nobody was talking about the war anymore. His blood pressure problems came much later though, & Taya didn't go into labour in the car. 
61
00:55:45,000 --> 00:56:12,000
TRUE-ISH
Taya gave birth to a boy, Kyle was with her. The film glossed over how traumatic it was. Taya she kept passing out & the baby got stuck. Kyle just wanted the kid out to save his wife. He admits it took him a long time to bond with his son. 
62
00:56:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
FALSE-ISH
Kyle was distant when he was home, which Taya hated. He didn't have a vendetta against Mustafa specifically though, he was just some sniper he'd heard of.
63
00:57:16,000 --> 00:58:57,000
FALSE-ISH
Jeff was a marine, he enlisted before 9/11. Kyle doesn't write about meeting his brother on the tarmac, though, or him cursing the war.
64
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:52,000
FALSE-ISH
Legend has it that there was initally a $20k bounty on Kyle's head in Iraq, later increasing to $80k. He laughed it off at the time, joking that his wife might turn him in. There was no Kill-The-Butcher action squad involving Kyle. 
65
00:59:52,000 --> 01:01:13,000
We couldn't find a source for this. 
Kyle was convinced that their job was to protect America. He wrote that he couldn't care less about the Iraqis. We don't know about Lee, though.

Although they weren't hunting The Butcher, they did bust into a few apartments & find families still living there. 
67
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:55,000

73
01:08:47,000 --> 01:09:26,000
TRUE-ISH
Kyle & his team found two men hanging in chains in a basement. Turns out they had been tortured by insurgents to make sure they didn't talk. One was dead, the other died while the marine corpsman worked on him. It wasn't anything to do with The Butcher, though.
74
01:09:26,000 --> 01:10:44,000
FALSE
Although The Butcher might have been a real person, Kyle had nothing to do with him. His role in Kyle's story was fabricated.

TRUE-ISH
Kyle was thanked in a garage back home by a guy whose life he saved in Fallujah. Taya claims he got all embarassed & humble. In the movie he was just with Colton, but in reality Taya was there. 
78
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
TRUE-ISH
Kyle's daughter had to go into hospital with suspected leukaemia. They performed all kinds of painful tests on her which got Kyle really angry. The nurses weren't ignoring her. They used this scene to show his protectiveness since they left out the leukaemia part. 
79
01:15:58,000 --> 01:17:48,000
TRUE
Kyle & Taya had serious problems as a result of his continued redeployment - she had had enough & wanted him home. She was upset that she would be making memories by herself. She recalls just holding McKenna & crying for days on end. 
80
01:17:48,000 --> 01:19:05,000

TRUE-ISH
The team's CO did suggest they step down for a few days to regroup, but this was after Lee's death, not Biggles' injury. When Biggles was injured, their chief asked Kyle if he wanted to go out & get payback. He didn't need to consider it for long. 
85
01:24:19,000 --> 01:26:47,000
TRUE-ISH
Marc Lee was killed in August 2006 while on a Team 3 mission. He was shot straight through the mouth just like in the film. He didn't die right away, though.

TRUE-ISH
Kyle did make a 2100 shot. He says it was really, really lucky. It probably wasn't Mustafa, though. Kyle thought it might have been at the time, but there was no way of knowing from that distance, & he later heard that Mustafa was still alive.
98
01:44:07,000 --> 01:47:56,000
TRUE-ISH
Kyle's long-distance shot didn't alert insurgents to their position & they weren't swarmed in the midst of a sandstorm. Another team did get caught in a building full of insurgents, & had to call in air support like in the movie. 
99
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
TRUE-ISH

01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:45,000
We couldn't find a source for this. 
Kyle suffered from depression when he first returned. His mind was still in the war & he resented Taya for pulling him back home. Still, he didn't mention the TV incident.
