00:00:43,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Unknown
We don't know for sure what state Mercury's health was in by that point, although he was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS soon afterwards. 
4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:31,000
TRUE
Princess Diana and Prince Charles were in the front row for the performance, next to Bob Geldof
5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:52,000
TRUE
Mercury adored cats and owned several as pets. 
6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:49,000
TRUE
Live Aid was unprecedented in scale. The Wembley performance drew in a 72,000-strong live audience, and another two billion watched around the world. MERCURY did have a Rolls Royce. 
7
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:46,000
TRUE
Professionally, Mercury was indeed fearless, despite personal insecurities. Live Aid was unprecedented in scale. The Wembley performance drew in a 72,000-strong live audience, and another two billion watched around the world. 
8
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:59,000
TRUE
Mercury did work as a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport before he became a star. 
9
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Unknown
Queen were founded only two years after Conservative politician Enoch Powell’s notorious 'rivers of blood' speech and racism towards immigrants was intense. Mercury, however, had white skin and kept quiet about his roots, so he might have escaped the worst of it. We just don't know. 
10
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:25,000
TRUE
Mercury was known for jotting down his lyrics and compositions on scraps of paper, something he had done since childhood. 
11
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:49,000
TRUE
Mercury's parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, were Parsis with family roots in India and Persia. Mercury was born in Zanzibar, and went to a posh boarding school in Bombay. 
12
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
TRUE
Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara, a name his mother chose because it was popular amoung the Parsis at the time. He started going by Freddie at boarding school. He changed him name legally in 1970 when Queen was formed. 
13
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:13,000
TRUE
As a devout man, his father didn't find Mercury's rock musician lifestyle easy to accept. Both parents hoped he would grow out of the rock star thing and return to 'proper studies'.
14
00:05:13,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TRUE
Smile played loads of gigs at student bars, especially at Imperial College London where May was studying. Mercury attended many of their performances. 
15
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:56,000
TRUE
Tim Staffell did leave Smile to join Humpy Bong, a band that included former Bee Gees drummer Colin Petersen. The label dropped the band shortly after Staffell joined. 
16
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:45,000
FALSE-ISH
Mercury didn't meet Austin the same night he met the band. Austin actually dated May first, and met Mercury once he had joined as lead singer. They remained close for the rest of Mercury's life. 
17
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:57,000
TRUE
They were disappointed but they understood - Smile wasn't going anywhere. 
18
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:24,000
FALSE
Mercury didn't meet the band at a gig. He had known the guys for years by the time he came to join the group. 
19
00:08:24,000 --> 00:09:19,000
FALSE-ISH
Mercury was mates with the band and constantly badgered the guys about becoming a member, which they relented to once Staffell had left. 
20
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
TRUE
He did have four extra teeth. While he was self-conscious of his mouth, he thought the extra teeth gave his voice an edge and never got them fixed. He became famous for both his teeth and his four-octave range.
21
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:38,000
TRUE
Although Mercury had a lot of personal insecurities, he was entirely confident in his professional life, never doubting his own talent. 
22
00:09:38,000 --> 00:10:17,000
TRUE
AUSTIN did work at Biba, which was a cool place to hang out at the time. MERCURY visited frequently over five or six months, usually with other guys from the band, before he finally asked her out.
23
00:10:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
TRUE
Austin recalls that she was intrigued by the 'wild-looking artistic musician'. 
24
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:46,000
TRUE-ISH
Keep Yourself Alive' was one of their earliest tracks, which they performed at various venues and student bars. But Deacon wasn't in the band at that point. He didn't join until 1971. 
25
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Unknown
Queen were founded only two years after Conservative politician Enoch Powell’s notorious 'rivers of blood' speech and racism towards immigrants was intense. Mercury, however, had white skin and kept quiet about his roots, so he might have escaped the worst of it. We just don't know. 
26
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:34,000
TRUE
Mercury's mic did snap in half during an early-career show. He liked the look, and used a bottomless mic from that point onwards.
27
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:55,000
TRUE-ISH
Smile bandmate Chris Chesney recalls Mercury saying 'do your own songs and I'll make up my own words' at his audition. We don't know if he improvised lyrics during live performances, though
28
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:28,000
TRUE
It was immediately clear he was a gifted frontman.
29
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:45,000
TRUE
Mercury moved into a small flat around this time, having just finished art college. 
30
00:13:45,000 --> 00:14:09,000
TRUE-ISH
They were totally broke in these early years. Signed with Trident production company, they barely made a penny from their success. While telling Taylor to stop breaking drumsticks because there was no money to buy more, the company manager was buying himself a Rolls Royce. 
31
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Unknown
We don't know whose idea it was to record an album. 
32
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:36,000
FALSE-ISH
They all had tracks in their back pockets and took a chance opportunity to record a five-track demo at De Lane Lea studios, a precursor to their first album. It wasn't done in one night. 
33
00:14:36,000 --> 00:15:55,000
TRUE
The band were always looking for ways to innovate. 
34
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:07,000
TRUE-ISH
EMI did get hold of a Queen demo in the early years, although not by accidentally walking into a studio.
35
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
TRUE
Mercury did design the famous Queen crest logo, utilising his talents in art and graphic design. He had a diploma from Ealing Art College.
36
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:30,000
TRUE
Taylor's mum recalls Mercury explaining the new name – trying to persuade everybody it sounded 'regal'. Their friends thought it was outrageous and hilarious. 
37
00:16:30,000 --> 00:17:09,000
TRUE
Mercury was known for his habit of composing songs in odd positions. He did have a piano as a headboard, so that he could reach back and play what he had heard in his dreams. He had been tinkering with the 'Mama' ballad since art school, trying to figure out what to do with it. 
38
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:41,000
TRUE
They were very much in love, and although they didn't stay together as a couple, Mercury took care of Austin until the day he died, when he left her his property and much of his money and royalties. 
39
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:56,000
TRUE-ISH
Austin's parents were both deaf. Austin did have tea with Mercury's family, although we don't know if her family were there too. 
40
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Unknown
There's no record of any naughty faux-pas happening at the family dinner. 
41
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Unknown
Mercury didn't speak about his background openly in public, so it's possible he didn't bring it up with Austin and the band, but we just don't know. 
42
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:54,000
FALSE-ISH
Mercury's family fled Zanzibar in 1964, to escape the revolution, but it wasn't quite a 'just the clothes on our backs' deal. His father worked for the British government. A highly privileged family, they were given six months to leave and relocated to a semi-detached house in Middlesex. 
43
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:11,000
TRUE
Mercury won trophies for boxing in his youth. 
44
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:28,000
TRUE
Mercury did change him name legally. It wasn't just a stage name for him, but reflected who he felt he really was. 
45
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:46,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury's family were very conservative. Most of them were lawyers or accountants, and his parents thought Mercury would grow out of his rockstar dreams and settle down. It seems likely they were uncomfortable with him legally changing his name, but we're speculating. 
46
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:20,000
TRUE
May did have a degree in astrophysics, and later returned to his studies to earn a PhD. Taylor did study dentistry, because his biology teacher had told him it was well paid. He eventually quit dentistry and got a degree in biology instead.
47
00:20:20,000 --> 00:21:03,000
TRUE-ISH
Reid, Elton John's manager, did want to manage Queen. Apparently it was a much more complicated process than a phone call and a meeting, though. 
48
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:25,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury's stage costume designer spoke of him as a free-thinker with clear ideas of what he wanted to wear. She designed his famous white cape, which had a similar batwing-inspired concertina effect to the jacket in this scene. The actual jacket Malek wore was found in Jimi Hendrix's flat after he died.  
49
00:21:25,000 --> 00:22:11,000
TRUE-ISH
The remaining band members have mused that Queen were never fashionable. Their fans didn't follow musical trends, and supported them through and through. 
50
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:21,000
FALSE
Prenter didn't come on the scene until after Live Aid, in 1977. 
51
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
TRUE-ISH
Reid did get Queen on Top of the Pops
52
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:51,000
FALSE-ISH
They did tour after their appearance on Top of the Pops, but not in Japan (that came later)
53
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:32,000
TRUE
They were certainly not happy about not actually being able to play/sing. The show was shot in the weather studio because of BBC strikes. Taylor said of the experience, 'It was rubbish, no-one actually played, just some aging disc jockeys. And the drums were plastic, so they made this "dook" noise when you hit them.'
54
00:23:32,000 --> 00:24:02,000
TRUE-ISH
Queen did perform Killer Queen on TOTP, but not until later that year. Their first TOTP performance was 'Seven Seas of Rhye'. The original footage was lost several years ago. 
55
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:15,000
TRUE-ISH
Queen didn't tour Japan until later, during their 1974-75 Sheer Heart Attack Tour. The Japanese fans adored them, though, and their Japan sets were a bit longer than their UK and US shows.  
56
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:58,000
TRUE
Mercury identified as a performer through and through, and felt Austin was the only true friend he ever had. 
57
00:24:58,000 --> 00:26:31,000
TRUE-ISH
Austin remembers, 'He gave me a big box on Christmas Day. Inside was another box, then another and so it went on... Eventually, I found a lovely jade ring inside the last small box.' Like in the movie, she asked which finger she should put it on, and he asked her to marry him, and she whispered her yes. 
58
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:49,000
FALSE
We don't know if this happened or not, but Austin doesn't mention this when she talks about the proposal in an interview
59
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:24,000
TRUE
Queen toured the US for the first time in 1974 after their record Queen I hit the charts
60
00:27:24,000 --> 00:29:53,000
TRUE
The tour was a massive hit. 
61
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:20,000
FALSE-ISH
There was no Ray Foster. There's a rumour that the character is loosely based on Roy Featherstone (the band's A&R guy at EMI) but represented a whole bunch of EMI execs. 
62
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:46,000
TRUE
The band nicknamed Jim Beach 'Miami', a play on his last name. 
63
00:30:46,000 --> 00:32:29,000
TRUE
Queen didn't like to repeat the same formula, and were always looking for ways to innovate. Mercury wanted the new record to be operatic, and the band were all for it. 
64
00:32:29,000 --> 00:34:18,000
TRUE-ISH
Queen did record 'Bohemian Rhapsody' at Rockfield Studios, a farmhouse-turned-recording-studio opened by two farmers, Kingsley and Charles Ward. 
65
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:59,000
TRUE
Mercury was known for jotting down his lyrics and compositions on scraps of paper, something he had done since childhood. 
66
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:54,000
FALSE
Prenter wasn't at Rockfield Farm - he wasn't hired until 1977.
67
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:13,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury wrote the song for Austin, of whom he later said, 'the only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else'. 
68
00:36:13,000 --> 00:37:23,000
FALSE-ISH
Prenter and Mercury did end up as lovers, but he didn't come on the scene for another two years.
69
00:37:23,000 --> 00:38:33,000
TRUE
May thought the song was a joke when he first heard it. Taylor insisted it became the B-side to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. Writers of the A- and B-sides had to split the record royalties equally, so Taylor raked in the rewards from Mercury's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' success. 
70
00:38:33,000 --> 00:39:50,000
TRUE
Mercury did finalise his composition at Rockfield Farm. 
71
00:39:50,000 --> 00:41:20,000
TRUE
May wrote that famous guitar solo, which Mercury thought was wonderful. 
72
00:41:20,000 --> 00:43:05,000
TRUE
Mercury would flounce in during the sessions saying 'I've just added a few more Galileos, dear'. The 24-track tape was passed through the machines so many times it was almost transparent by the time the recording was complete. The band revelled in the creativity. Mercury wanted to 'go well over the top'.
73
00:43:05,000 --> 00:45:22,000
TRUE-ISH
Several EMI execs were concerned that the track was too long for radio. One exec, Paul Watts, recalled 'when they played me Bohemian Rhapsody my reaction was, "what the fuck's this? Are you mad?"'. 
74
00:45:22,000 --> 00:46:47,000
FALSE-ISH
There's no record of Queen storming out, but there was some tension over all this.
75
00:46:47,000 --> 00:47:34,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury did throw a brick through a window, but not at EMI. After a row with Reid, Mercury launched a brick through the window of Reid's Knightsbridge home, and stood on the street yelling until Reid invited him in. 
76
00:47:34,000 --> 00:48:29,000
TRUE
Everett was pivotal in getting the track out there. Some say he was sent a demo and told not to play it, others say he stole it. He played it 14 times in one weekend, claiming on every play that 'his finger slipped'. Mercury did make an appearance on Everett's breakfast show, but not that particular broadcast. 
77
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:38,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury met Everett when he appeared on his breakfast show. They didn't hook up but they did hit it off, and the pair were a staple on the London club scene. 
78
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:53,000
TRUE
Bohemian Rhapsody' bombed with the critics, drawing all the comments shown in the film. 
79
00:48:53,000 --> 00:50:19,000
TRUE
Crowds went wild for Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' performance at Edinburgh in 1976. The show won them a standing ovation. 
80
00:50:19,000 --> 00:51:00,000
TRUE
Queen's 'A Night at the Opera' tour took in a whopping 77 performances 
81
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:31,000
TRUE
Austin knew that something was wrong between them during the final two years of their six-year relationship. Freddie would indeed call to speak to his cats while he was away on tour. 
82
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:45,000
TRUE
Austin has said she knew he was with men during the last years of their relationship. 
83
00:51:45,000 --> 00:52:14,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury and Prenter did end up lovers, but not until a couple of years later. During their time together there hookups and hotel rooms galore. 
84
00:52:14,000 --> 00:53:37,000
TRUE
And she was. Mercury said of her, 'to me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage', replacing her was 'simply impossible'. Austin was a big part of his will after he passed away. She received his property, much of his money and his royalties.
85
00:53:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
TRUE
Austin figured out that Mercury was into men long before he told her, and she was right. Austin remembers saying ‘No Freddie, I don’t think you are bisexual. I think you are gay.' Mercury always refused to define his sexuality publically, so it's unclear whether he was gay, bisexual or otherwise. 
86
00:54:44,000 --> 00:56:58,000
TRUE
They did end their engagement after Mercury came out. He told her he wanted her to always be part of his life.
87
00:56:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
TRUE
Mercury bought a mansion in Kensington, known as Garden Lodge. Mercury did treat his cats like his children. 
88
00:58:02,000 --> 00:59:56,000
TRUE
Mercury never stopped adoring Austin and always wanted her around. The record company bought her a place near Mercury when she moved out of their shared home. 
89
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:24,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury threw extraordinary parties. There were trolls, dwarfs, ogres, thieves, ballerinas, transvestites, flamenco dancers, fireworks... His grand parties went on for days, weeks. For one party, guests had to dress as their favourite person. MERCURY dressed as himself. Prenter wasn't on the scene yet, though. 
90
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:46,000
TRUE
Mercury was known for these grand parties, and for his lavish gifts. 
91
01:00:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
TRUE-ISH
Austin watched from the sidelines to some extent during Mercury's years with Prenter. Taylor couldn't stand the guy. All this came later, though. Prenter wasn't on the scene yet. 
92
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:29,000
TRUE-ISH
Austin watched from the sidelines to some extent during Mercury's years with Prenter. Taylor couldn't stand the guy. All this came later, though. Prenter wasn't on the scene yet. 
93
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:37,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury and May fell out all the time
94
01:02:37,000 --> 01:03:08,000
TRUE
Prenter is often accused of leading Mercury astray, encouraging a wild lifestyle. They partied constantly. 
95
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:42,000
FALSE
This never happened. Mercury met Hutton at Heaven, one of London's premier gay nightclubs. 
96
01:03:42,000 --> 01:04:17,000
FALSE
This never happened. Mercury met Hutton at Heaven, one of London's premier gay nightclubs. 
97
01:04:17,000 --> 01:05:47,000
FALSE-ISH
Hutton did reject Mercury the first time they met, but it was a 'fuck off' in a bar, not an insightful distancing. 
98
01:05:47,000 --> 01:06:58,000
TRUE
MAY came up with the idea for a song that audience could get involved with after being inspired by the audience singing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' to Queen at the end of a gig. He went to sleep thinking, they can stamp their feet, clap their hands, and sing. And he woke up with 'We Will Rock You' in his head. 
99
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury and May fell out all the time, especially during the Prenter years. 
100
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:54,000
TRUE
Like May, Mercury was into the idea of a track that really involved the audience. He was all for 'We Will Rock You', and wrote 'We Are the Champions' to release alongside it. 
101
01:07:54,000 --> 01:09:45,000
TRUE
May has described the Madison Square Garden gig as a landmark moment for the band, a magical experience. 
102
01:09:45,000 --> 01:10:04,000
TRUE
Mercury is considered one of the greatest frontmen of all time, always able to command audiences. They lapped up his call and response bit. 
103
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:17,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury was interested in going solo, but Prenter and Reid weren't involved in Queen's management at this stage. 
104
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:35,000
TRUE
CBS did offer Mercury massive money for a solo album. 
105
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:46,000
FALSE
Reid and Prenter weren't in the picture at this stage. 
106
01:10:46,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Unknown
We don't know what Mercury felt about Austin's lovers. 
107
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:54,000
FALSE
Reid and Prenter weren't in the picture at this stage. 
108
01:12:54,000 --> 01:14:09,000
FALSE
Mercury actually wanted to go solo and Reid was no longer involved with the band at this point. Reid later said he'd never had any problems with Queen, and 'that's been one of the gentlest parting of the ways of anybody I've ever worked with'. Taylor has said the band had a 'good working relationship with John'.
109
01:14:09,000 --> 01:15:09,000
FALSE
Prenter didn't come into Mercury's life until years after Reid had ceased managing Queen. 
110
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:26,000
TRUE-ISH
The exposé was published, although not until later. Prenter sold his story, along with photos of Mercury with various lovers, to The Sun newspaper for £32,000. They ran with the header 'All the Queen's Men'. 
111
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:38,000
TRUE-ISH
Later than shown in the film – in the late 70s – Prenter tried to steer the bands sound towards disco and funk. His influence on their style created tension. Taylor and May were especially resentful and the band often fought when the pressure was on.

01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
FALSE-ISH
They did part ways with Reid, but the band were all agreed on it

115
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
TRUE
The band argued constantly, especially when the pressure was on. Mercury and Taylor were the hotheads of the group. 
116
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:44,000
TRUE-ISH
May was always the most sensitive in the band, wanting everybody to be happy, but he could be ruthless when he wanted to be and admits he rarely backed down.
117
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
TRUE
Deacon was very down to earth and calm and he remained that way. Always much more a family man than a rockstar, it took him years to even start finding his voice with the other guys, and he virtually became a recluse in later life. 
118
01:16:48,000 --> 01:17:38,000
TRUE-ISH
Deacon did write 'Another One Bites the Dust', which Michael Jackson suggested be released as a single. It was a massive number one hit and won an American Music Award. However, it wasn't released until much later – 1980.
119
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:50,000
TRUE
Beach became their manager after the band left Reid's management
120
01:17:50,000 --> 01:19:00,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury took to the gay scene like a duck to water. He didn't meet Prenter until later on, but they were immersed in it, especially while working in Munich. 
121
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
TRUE-ISH
Once Mercury started getting sick he struggled terribly in the studio, but this didn't come until later. 
122
01:19:04,000 --> 01:20:42,000
TRUE-ISH
The press absolutely hounded Mercury, vilifying him for his sexuality and his wild lifestyle. The press conference in the scene was a conglomeration of the worst of it, quoting parts from various interviews over the years. Mercury and the band found it unbearable.

124
01:21:43,000 --> 01:22:08,000
TRUE
Mercury admitted he suffered loneliness: 'Because audiences love me, it’s hard for them to believe that somebody like Freddie Mercury could be lonely’ ‘In fact, my kind of loneliness is the hardest. I can be in a crowd and still be the loneliest person, because I don’t really belong to anyone’.
125
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:50,000
TRUE
The video for 'I Want to Break Free' featured the entire band in drag, a parody of Coronation Street.

Mercury met Hutton in a nightclub, he didn't use the phonebook to search London for him.

128
01:23:20,000 --> 01:24:10,000
TRUE
MTV banned the 'I Want to Break Free' video. Deacon wrote the song and Taylor came up with the drag idea. The theme was a parody of Coronation Street, but the humour was lost on US audiences. Mercury did pull away from Queen at this time, recording his first solo track the same year 'I Want to Break Free' was released. 
129
01:24:10,000 --> 01:26:57,000
FALSE-ISH
The band fought a lot and it often got personal. They did take a break at this point, but it was unanimous. Mercury wanted to pursue solo projects, but so did the others. May has said, 'It was breaking up the whole time! All of us left the band at some point, and not just one time - all the way through.'
130
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Unknown
Prenter was accused of preventing Mercury from appearing on radio shows and having excessive control over his life. We don't know if he tried to keep Austin away, though. 
131
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:54,000
TRUE
Other band members have said that Queen's arguments, the battle of egos, pushed every track to it's max potential. Without that, Mercury's output lost its edge, and he quickly returned to working with Queen instead. 
132
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:29,000
TRUE-ISH
May describes this period of sex, drugs, and partying with Prenter as a dangerous and vulnerable time for Mercury. This didn't happen until later, though.
133
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:40,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury likely experienced this symptom as a result of the AIDS-related respiratory disease that ultimately caused his death. However, signs of his illness didn't come until a year or two later. 
134
01:28:40,000 --> 01:29:55,000
TRUE-ISH
We don't know if Austin visited Mercury in Munich. But there's no doubt he was consuming a lot of alcohol and a lot of cocaine at this point in his life (which came later than the film's timeline). She has said all she could do was watch from the sidelines. 
135
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:41,000
FALSE
Mercury did know what Live Aid was, and wasn't keen to take part.

We don't know if this ever happened. 
138
01:32:14,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Unknown
Those close to Mercury were worried about his life in Munich with Prenter. They saw him as vulnerable and living a dangerous lifestyle. Mercury had started to see it himself, too. We don't know if Austin went to Munich to try and bring him home, though. 
139
01:33:44,000 --> 01:36:07,000
TRUE-ISH
Their relationship broke down after Mercury ditched the drinking, drugs and parties. Queen's former roadie recalls that the final straw was when Prenter threw a party at Mercury's house and trashed the place. Mercury fired him, and like in the film, Prenter did rant and rave and threaten to expose him. 
140
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:16,000
FALSE
Prenter sold his story to the papers, he didn't appear on TV. 
141
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:42,000
TRUE
Prenter sold his story to the Sun newspaper for £32,000. He provided photos of Mercury with various lovers and told the world about his lifestyle, and how much he feared AIDS. 
142
01:36:42,000 --> 01:37:48,000
FALSE
Mercury was actually reticent about Live Aid, and the band weren't that disconnected after Mercury did his solo thing. Taylor recalls, 'I don't think Freddie really wanted to go solo... when it came down to actually doing a solo album, he did sort of miss us'. Both May and Taylor appeared on Mercury's first solo single. 
143
01:37:48,000 --> 01:38:10,000
FALSE-ISH
Prenter did talk publically about Mercury being afraid to be alone, but there's no record of him using racist slurs against him. 
144
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:35,000
FALSE
Queen had numerous meetings about their status as a group, whether they were breaking up or not. They didn't ever actually break up, though.  
145
01:38:35,000 --> 01:40:33,000

Queen had numerous meetings about their status as a group, whether they were breaking up or not. They didn't ever actually break up, though.

01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:50,000
TRUE-ISH
The band members didn't share songwriting credits for an entire album until 1989's 'The Miracle'.
149
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,000
TRUE-ISH
May and Taylor have both said that Prenter was 'a very, very bad influence upon Freddie', and on the band. They didn't want him around. Mercury did fire Prenter eventually, but it wasn't until 1986.
150
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
TRUE
The line-up had been published and every ticket sold before Queen agreed to join in last-minute. The biggest names in music were all performing.  
151
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:24,000
FALSE
The band were actually very much together and very-well rehearsed by time Live Aid came around. They had released 'The Works' in 1984 and had been touring, with the last tour date just eight weeks before Live Aid. Mercury was actually reticent to do Live Aid, but was persuaded by Geldof. 
152
01:43:24,000 --> 01:44:04,000
TRUE

Mercury lived in fear of contracting HIV, particularly after his friends and lovers started to die from AIDS. 
154
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury did have an AIDS test in 1985, although the results were negative. He was tested again in 1987, when he recieved his positive diagnosis – later than shown in the film. 
155
01:44:37,000 --> 01:45:21,000
TRUE-ISH

Unknown
Nobody knows what happened at those appointments. 
157
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:40,000
TRUE-ISH
In the film there's the suggestion that this cough was part of Mercury's declining health due to AIDS. In reality, he did have a sore throat during Live Aid rehearsals, and performed against his doctor's advice. But it was just a throat infection. 
158
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:54,000
TRUE
BEACH did know about Mercury's diagnosis before the band did. Mercury told him, but asked him to keep it secret. 
159
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:02,000
FALSE
Mercury didn't confirm his diagnosis to his bandmates until 1989, not 1985 as shown in the film. Although they had worked it out for themselves much earlier.
160
01:47:02,000 --> 01:49:09,000
TRUE
When Mercury told the band he had AIDS, he insisted that he didn't want it discussed further, he just wanted to ignore it and make music until 'I fucking well drop'. That was the only direct conversation they ever had about it. The band were all devastated. 
161
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:33,000
TRUE-ISH
There's some great footage of Mercury doing vocal warmups, although not from Live Aid day.
162
01:49:33,000 --> 01:50:01,000
TRUE
Geldof was broadcast live several times throughout the concert, pushing for donations. He did swear during one of them, which was all very exciting for the folks at the BBC
163
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:46,000
FALSE
In the film, this is the second time they met. In reality, the second time they met was at Heaven nightclub in London – the same spot as their first meeting. The first time, Hutton turned down a drink from Mercury. A year and a half later, just before Live Aid, he accepted the same offer. 
164
01:50:46,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Unknown
We don't know if Mercury ever introduced Hutton to his parents. He never came out to them, though. 
165
01:52:42,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Unknown
We don't know how Austin felt about Hutton, although there are rumours of hostility between them in later years. However, Austin has said she was relieved and euphoric to finally see Mercury living his sexuality freely. 
166
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Unknown
We don't know what Mercury thought of Austin's lovers.
167
01:53:52,000 --> 01:54:21,000
TRUE-ISH
The PA limiters were switched so that Queen's performance would be louder, but this was done by Queen's sound engineer, not Beach. 
168
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:48,000
TRUE
Mercury owned the stage the moment he stepped out, making 'the world his stadium'
169
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:57,000
TRUE
Almost seven hours in, Live Aid had raised just £1.2 million, and Geldof was sorely disappointed. 
170
01:54:57,000 --> 01:56:44,000
TRUE
Mecury did open Queen's section sitting at the piano, playing Bohemian Rhapsody. He even adjusted a knob like in the movie. The audience sang along, 'as if this was what they had waited for all day'.
171
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
TRUE-ISH
Mercury was very close to his mum. She always came to see Queen when they played nearby. She always supported his musical endeavors. Mercury can be seen blowing a kiss to the camera as he sings the 'Mama' ballad at Live Aid, although we don't know if it was to his mother.
172
01:56:48,000 --> 01:57:16,000

02:01:24,000 --> 02:04:10,000

Geldof, pumped up by Queen's amazing performance, gave a shouty interview full of profanities, calling for donations. After his outburst, donations increased to £300 per second.
176
02:04:10,000 --> 02:08:29,000
TRUE
Mercury's stage-craft and energy that night became legendary, with many calling it one of the best live performances in history. May has said it was the greatest day of their lives. Elton John told them, 'You bastards, you stole the show!'
177
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:36,000
TRUE
He died at his Kensington home in Nov 24th, 1991, having made a public statement revealing his battle with AIDS the day before.
