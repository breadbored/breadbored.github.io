Kirkland was easy to hack because they kept everything open.
15
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:27,000
TRUE-ISH
The book claims all-male Phoenix Club brought in beautiful girls from schools in the area to entertain them at parties. Other sources claim this never happened. 
16
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:40,000
TRUE
Eliot was an open system, but without an index. Still, easy for Zuckerberg to hack.

27
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:45,000
FALSE
This bit wasn't in the book, & it has been suggested that such a crash was unlikely, especially given that Harvard's servers managed the even-more-popular Facebook just fine. 
28
00:15:45,000 --> 00:16:18,000
FALSE
Facemash did go down after a few hours. One source claims Harvard's computer services noticed the surge in traffic & shut down Zuckerberg's web access. However, the book states that Zuckerberg panicked & shut it down himself.  
29
00:16:18,000 --> 00:17:00,000

There wasn't an Erica, but Saverin did sue Zuckerberg. 
30
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:15,000
TRUE
The site did get that many hits, but in the book there is no Marylin character - it doesn't go into the details of the deposition at all. Still, he had a team of lawyers - it's likely they talked about the hits at some stage.

TRUE
Zuckerberg has stated that the main thing they got right was his wardrobe, which was spot on, 'like every single shirt or fleece they have in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own'. Zuckerberg did have to face the ad board on those charges.

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,000
TRUE-ISH
The Winklevoss twins took Narendra, not Zuckerberg, into the bike room for meetings; not a member of the Porcellian, he was not allowed any further. 
41
00:22:21,000 --> 00:23:07,000
TRUE
Zuckerberg created Coursematch for Harvard students in 2003. Also created Synapse, a plug-in for MP3 player Winamp. Offered up to $2m for it, but uploaded it for free. Later tried to sell but didn't get the offers since it had been available for nothing.
42
00:23:07,000 --> 00:24:20,000
TRUE
The Winklevoss twins & Narendra asked Zuckerberg for help with their Harvard dating site idea. He agreed, & they thought he was working on it in the 3 months between Facemash & TheFacebook.
43
00:24:20,000 --> 00:25:07,000
TRUE
Zuckerberg did have to defend himself in depositions against these people, but the details are not available. According to the book, Zuckerberg presented his idea to Saverin in a restaurant rather than at the Caribbean night, but they did attend the Caribbean night. 
44
00:25:07,000 --> 00:26:39,000
TRUE-ISH
Saverin & Zuckerberg attended a Caribbean-themed Phoenix Club party, though not together. They were at similar party later when Saverin befriended Zuckerberg, having heard about his computer genius. Saverin was punched by the Phoenix Club in his junior year. I
45
00:26:39,000 --> 00:27:30,000
TRUE
Although Zuckerberg pitched his idea to Saverin in a restaurant, rather than outside a party, he did explain TheFacebook as an exclusive online social network where people had to be invited, which Saverin thought was much like an online version of a Final Club.
46
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Deposition has remained private, with other a few details leaked online.

50
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
TRUE
Zuckerberg proposed a 70/30 split, with Saverin getting CFO position in the company along with his 30%.
51
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
TRUE
He thought those terms were reasonable. 
52
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,000
FALSE
This particularly cold line of argument from Zuckerberg didn't feature in the book. 
53
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:56,000
FALSE
This aspect of things didn't feature in the book. Saverin thought Zuckerberg had screwed him over, but he didn't have a theory about why in particular. The suggestion was that he blamed Parker more than he blamed Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg certainly was mega-loaded. 
54
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Not in the book.
The conversation wasn't recorded in the book.

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:17,000
TRUE
In the book Saverin claimed that Zuckerberg scoffed at HarvardConnection & decided it wasn't worth his time, while continuing to communicate with them. No mention of him copying the idea from Narendra & the Winklevoss twins.

TRUE
11th Jan 2004 Zuckerberg paid $35 to register TheFacebook for a year. Went live for Harvard students 4th Feb 2004. When they removed the 'The', they paid $200k for a new domain name, debuted on 20th Sept 2005. 
63
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,000
TRUE-ISH
The twins claimed they had emails from Zuckerberg updating them on his progress. Whether or not these emails were truthful is difficult to know. However, according to the book Saverin did think that Zuckerberg hadn't done the work for HarvardConnection. 
64
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:10,000
TRUE
7 weeks into the HarvardConnection deal Zuckerberg expressed negativity about the idea for the first time, which worried the team, given his previous enthusiasm. 
65
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:51,000
FALSE
This scene doesn't appear in the book. Social network sites were gaining popularity & there was several out there before both HarvardConnection & TheFacebook. Both were derivative. As for the code, there isn't a public copy of the original sets of code for comparison. 
66
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:42,000
TRUE-ISH
Zuckerberg got the idea for adding 'relationship status' & 'interested in' to TheFacebook & raced to add it to the site, but we don't know where it came from.
67
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:57,000
TRUE
The site was almost ready to be launched, so Saverin was waiting for Zuckerberg to return to the dorm & get things finalised. 
68
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:45,000
TRUE
Zuckerberg added those features at the last minute, the finishing touches. Saverin thought they were great & would distinguish TheFacebook from other social networking sites. 
69
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:59,000
FALSE
In the book, it was only Zuckerberg's name on the masthead when the site went live. Saverin didn't mind. 
70
00:36:59,000 --> 00:38:08,000
TRUE-ISH
Zuckerberg did send TheFacebook out through the Phoenix Club mailing list, but it had been Saverin's idea. The book describes Zuckerberg as 'bobbing' oddly while he stared at the screen, waiting to see what would happen. 
71
00:38:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000

This scene wasn't in the book.

73
00:39:46,000 --> 00:42:41,000
TRUE
They did get legal counsel & considered all their options for taking Zuckerberg down, but preferred not to take legal action if they could help it. Much of their frustration with Zuckerberg was related to his ethical breach; honour was really important to the twins.
74
00:42:41,000 --> 00:43:52,000
FALSE
This scene wasn't in the book. We don't know Zuckerberg's motivations for going to Saverin for funds.

TRUE
Facebook reached a million users within the first year.
76
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:27,000
TRUE
In the book we first hear the phrase 'Facebook me' from Christy (Kelly), when she introduces herself to Saverin. Narendra doesn't mention it in the book, although he would have known about it. 
77
00:44:27,000 --> 00:45:42,000
TRUE-ISH
Bill Gates did give a speech at Harvard. Christy was actually a girl named Kelly, who was Saverin's girlfriend. Kelly & Alice introduced themselves at the presentation, excited to meet TheFacebook's then celebrity creators.  
78
00:45:42,000 --> 00:46:35,000

The pair, but especially Zuckerberg, were getting pointed at & whispered about after TheFacebook launched. 
79
00:46:35,000 --> 00:47:30,000

TRUE
The twins sent Zuckerberg a cease & desist in Feb of 2004, soon after TheFacebook launched. 
81
00:48:55,000 --> 00:50:42,000
FALSE-ISH
The depositions details aren't in the book & only a few snippets have been leaked online. The email exchanges between Zuckerberg & the twins appear online in various forms, but can't be verifed. 
82
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:56,000
TRUE
The girls invited them for drinks that night, Saverin passed on the message to Zuckerberg, who thought it was an 'interesting' idea.

86
00:53:46,000 --> 00:54:32,000
TRUE

87
00:54:32,000 --> 00:55:40,000
No Marylin character in the book. 
Zuckerberg's deposition lawyers weren't in the book, & this comment was never recorded.

The twins used their connections to meet Summers, wanted to get him to punish Zuckerberg.
89

TRUE-ISH
In the book, Parker woke up in his own room, which was near enough attached to the Stanford dorms although he wasn't a student there. There were bits of girls' clothing around the place. He lay there & reminised about his previous ventures, his success with girls etc. 
90
00:59:08,000 --> 01:00:16,000
TRUE
Parker did discover TheFacebook on a girl's laptop, & decided to seek out Zuckerberg. He emailed Saverin & Saverin set up the meeting at 66 in New York. 
91
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:39,000
TRUE
The twins pulled all the connections they had to get a meeting with SUMMERS. His office was in Mass Hall, one of the oldest buildings in Harvard square.
92
01:00:39,000 --> 01:04:04,000
TRUE
Summers showed no interest in the case, claimed it was out of Harvard's jurisdiction. Irritated that the twins had taken up his time with it. 
93
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:15,000
FALSE-ISH
The twins did leave Summers' office in a rage. They didn't break the doorknob, though.

TRUE
Zuckerberg & Saverin met several advertisers together in NY.
95
01:04:47,000 --> 01:05:19,000
TRUE
Saverin set up numerous meetings with potential advertisers. Zuckerberg, not interested in the 'uncool' world of suits & money, slept through most of them or stayed silent the whole way through. The ad guys didn't 'get' the site, & the meetings failed. 
96
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:30,000

After meeting with advertisers they met with Parker. 
97
01:05:30,000 --> 01:06:00,000

01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:15,000
TRUE
From Saverin's online research into Parker, he didn't trust him at all.

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,000
TRUE

103
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:26,000
TRUE

FALSE
In the book Parker didn't talk to Saverin about being followed.
109
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:39,000
TRUE
Parker did think he was being watched. He saw cars with blacked-out windows following him, heard clicks on his phoneline, got weird callbacks on his mobile etc. Thought it was Moritz getting dirt on him so he could push him out of Plaxo. 
110
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
FALSE
Saverin didn't mention anything about Parker being delusional in the book, but he certainly thought he was a snake. 
111
01:08:40,000 --> 01:09:00,000
TRUE-ISH
That was Parker's view of Napster. While the conversation didn't come up explicitly in the book, we know Parker told them everything & that Saverin didn't trust him.

TRUE-ISH
Zuckerberg wasn't keen on ads because they weren't cool, & that Parker was on the same page, advising them to aim for $1bn first. There was tension between Saverin & the others.

TRUE
Parker picked up the check on his way out. 
117
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:18,000
TRUE-ISH
The' was dropped from TheFacebook gradually by its users. However, one of the first things Parker thought when he discovered the site was 'why not just Facebook?' & he did push for dropping the 'The' officially. 
118
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:41,000
TRUE-ISH
Although this particular scene doesn't feature in the book, we know Saverin & Zuckerberg disagreed throughout about whether, & when, & how to monetise Facebook. 
119
01:11:41,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Not in the book.
We don't know if this was raised in the deposition. The depositions didn't appear in the book & most of the details are sealed.

160
01:44:48,000 --> 01:45:18,000
FALSE

TRUE
The police broke up the party - Parker thought it was a set up, given it was a pretty standard frat-type party near campus.

167
01:48:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000

Although the Marylin character didn't appear in the book, the case was resolved in a settlement, so it's reasonable to assume Zuckerberg got this advice from his lawyers at some stage. 
172
01:53:44,000 --> 01:54:36,000
FALSE-ISH
Zuckerberg wasn't pining over an ex at this point - he had the same girlfriend throughout. Chris Hughes has said it was never about girls or power for Zuckerberg. 
173
01:54:36,000 --> 01:56:35,000
TRUE
Settlement details are correct. Winklevoss twins were paid in cash & assets - later found the assets had been undervalued, but the case wasn't reopened. Zuckerberg was the youngest billionaire in 2010, & Facebook did have over 500m members at that point.
