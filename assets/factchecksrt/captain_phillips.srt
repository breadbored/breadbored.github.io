6
00:03:25,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TRUE

TRUE
Phillips was taken to the port at Salalah by car.
18
00:09:46,000 --> 00:10:39,000
TRUE
When Phillips boarded the Maersk Alabama in port he checked it over for several hours, & found security measures had slipped. Doors were unlocked, pirate cages not shut, etc. 
19
00:10:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
TRUE
Phillips already knew Shane & Mike, & worked well with them. All three were serious & proactive. The rest he got along with ok at first meeting, although he was unsure about one of the senior sailors. Phillips was known for being tough with his crew.
20
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,000
TRUE
The Maersk Alabama was carrying commercial cargo, along with freshwater & food aid for Kenya. 
21
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:30,000
TRUE
The route through from Salalah to Mombasa was known as the EAF4 run (East Africa 4).
22
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:49,000
TRUE
Phillips was hot on security & ordered the crew to take extra care.
23
00:12:49,000 --> 00:14:23,000
TRUE
The Maersk Alabama set sail from Salalah in April 2009.
24
00:14:23,000 --> 00:15:04,000
TRUE
Phillips was safety conscious & walked the boat up & down doing checks before they set sail.
25
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:31,000
FALSE-ISH
This incident wasn't recorded in the memoir, although Phillips was known for being a hard taskmaster, & many of the crew disliked him. 
26
00:15:31,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We don't have the pirates' side of things.
We don't have the pirates' side of the story. 3 of the 4 were shot dead by Navy SEALS, & the remaining pirate, now in jail, refused to speak to the filmmakers.
27
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:54,000
TRUE
Phillips received a number of bulletins about pirate activity off the Somali coast. Since 2005 sailing the Horn of Africa had become extremely dangerous, with hijacks, shootings, etc. One bulletin reported 39 attacks in a single week.
28
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:48,000
TRUE
Phillips ordered a pirate intrusion drill. Shane is keen, the third mate, Colin Wright, was hesitant but followed orders. 
29
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:38,000
TRUE
The crew tested the pirate hoses as part of the drill. A valve had been left open & there was no water. 
30
00:18:38,000 --> 00:19:06,000
TRUE
Phillips noticed three blips on the screen.
31
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:20,000
TRUE
Phillips used the binoculars to identify what he thought might be a pirate mothership & a couple of 'skiffs', small wooden boats with little engines. 
32
00:19:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
FALSE
Phillips was portrayed as more of a team player in the film than he was in reality. He left his crew to carry on with the fire drill they had been conducting while he decided what to do about the pirates. 
33
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:43,000
TRUE
Phillips upped the speed, the chief engineer let him know how far they could push the engine.
34
00:20:43,000 --> 00:21:54,000
TRUE
Maritime Emergency didn't pick up. UKMTO were condescending & unhelpful, but took details. 
35
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We don't have the pirates' side of things.
We don't have the pirates' side of the story. 3 of the 4 were shot dead by Navy SEALS, & the remaining pirate, now in jail, refused to speak to the filmmakers.
36
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:56,000
TRUE-ISH
Phillips kept the chief engineer in the loop regarding speed, notifying him of any increases. The engineer let him know that the ship engines were ok. However, the captain didn't have to request clearance as such. 
37
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:10,000
TRUE
The small boats were struggling against the waves.
38
00:23:10,000 --> 00:24:25,000
TRUE
Phillips pretended to be in contact with the navy, faked a radio call, attempting to trick the pirates into thinking they were armed & air support was coming. 
39
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:57,000
TRUE
One of the small boats did turn around at that point. 
40
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:17,000
FALSE-ISH
Phillips kept the chief engineer in the loop regarding speed, notifying him of any increases. The engineer let him know that the ship engines were ok. However, the captain didn't have to request clearance as such. 
41
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:36,000
TRUE
The pirates got pretty close, around 4 miles away.
42
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
TRUE
Phillips put the ship into manoeuvres, which created waves & tossed the little pirate boats around. 
43
00:25:44,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The little boats struggled in the water.
Although we don't have the pirates' side of the story, the little boat was clearly struggling on the waves & couldn't keep up in the swell of the ship. They had put the little boats into the water off the mothership at too great a distance. 
44
00:27:09,000 --> 00:28:07,000
TRUE-ISH
Phillips addressed the crew after the first attack, debriefing them & giving tips in case it happened again. The book doesn't record him praising them, though. 
45
00:28:07,000 --> 00:29:38,000
TRUE-ISH
Members of the crew did approach Phillips with their fears after the first incident, although the memoir doesn't record any conversations about pay or rights. 
46
00:29:38,000 --> 00:30:12,000
FALSE-ISH
Phillips did email his wife regularly, but he always told her the truth about the bad stuff. 
47
00:30:12,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We don't have the pirates' side of things.
We don't have the pirates' side of the story. 3 of the 4 were shot dead by Navy SEALS, & the remaining pirate, now in jail, refused to speak to the filmmakers.
48
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:46,000
TRUE-ISH
There were 3 pirate incidents in the book, whereas the film records only 2, rolling the second 2 into 1. In the 2nd incident, Ken radioed Phillips to come to the bridge - pirates were calling over the radio. 
49
00:32:46,000 --> 00:34:24,000
TRUE-ISH
At the third pirate encounter Phillips was already on the bridge, he ordered a change of course & increased speed. He reported to UKMTO, rather than US Maritime Emergency. 
50
00:34:24,000 --> 00:35:18,000
TRUE-ISH
This part was a blend of the second & third incidents. In the second incident, the pirates radioed the ship. In the third incident, they opened fire. 
51
00:35:18,000 --> 00:37:32,000
TRUE-ISH
The crew turned the protective hoses on, but no mention of one being broken. However, they did fail against the pirates & they were able to get on board with ease.
52
00:37:32,000 --> 00:38:21,000
TRUE-ISH
Phillips didn't order the crew to the engine room, but they knew that was their safe room. Phillips let the bosun know what was happening so he could round up the men, while Phillips stayed on the bridge. 
53
00:38:21,000 --> 00:39:53,000
TRUE
The pirates did shoot into the bridge. Phillips put in a sly call to the engine room to close of the steering from the bridge & take over the controls from down there. 
54
00:39:53,000 --> 00:41:00,000
FALSE-ISH
This didn't happen, but Phillips hoped they would stay hidden & refused to tell the pirates where they were. 
55
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:14,000
TRUE-ISH
They had agreed on a safe room & a back up safe room earlier in the trip. One was through the engine room & in after steering.
56
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:49,000
TRUE
They got into the bridge within 5 minutes of boarding the ship. They were armed with AK47s. 
57
00:41:49,000 --> 00:43:16,000
TRUE-ISH
The pirate leader did implore them to relax & give in, it was 'just business'. At a later stage Phillips offered them the $30k that was in the safe.
58
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:29,000
TRUE
Because the engineers had closed off control from the bridge, it appeared to the pirates that the ship was broken, much to their frustration. 
59
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,000
TRUE
The whole ship was burning up without the AC & ventilation systems running.
60
00:43:37,000 --> 00:44:52,000
TRUE
Phillips told the pirates they had broken the ship by slowing it down too fast, & it was now circling in the water. The pirates got annoyed & demanded they stop the ship immediately, turn it completely off. 
61
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:34,000
TRUE
The pirate leader demanded the crew come to the bridge. Phillips put out several calls on the radio but his crew didn't respond. He had told them previously to hide in a safe room. The pirates threatened to kill Colin & ATM if the crew didn't arrive within the minute. 
62
00:45:34,000 --> 00:46:55,000
FALSE
Phillips never asked that the pirates shoot him to protect his crew. 
63
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:49,000
TRUE-ISH
The leader did demand to search the ship after one crew member wandered onto the bridge. Phillips wasn't exactly sure where his crew were & if they all knew the situation. He didn't radio a warning, but did stall as much as possible. 
64
00:47:49,000 --> 00:48:05,000
FALSE
There was nothing written about disabling the lights in the memoir. 
65
00:48:05,000 --> 00:49:49,000
TRUE-ISH
The pirates did demand to search the ship, although no map was mentioned in the book, & it wasn't Phillips who led them round. 
66
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:59,000
TRUE-ISH
Although it wasn't the galley, Shane was moving around the ship during the attack.
67
00:49:59,000 --> 00:51:39,000
TRUE-ISH
Shane was hiding in more than one of the rooms the pirates entered. Phillips didn't know until afterwards that he had been there at all. Although it happened slightly later than this point in the movie, Phillips did give melons & juice boxes to the pirates. 
68
00:51:39,000 --> 00:52:06,000
FALSE
The broken glass thing didn't happen. 
69
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:42,000
TRUE
Two crew members, Colin & ATM, were on the bridge with Phillips when the pirates attacked. 
70
00:52:42,000 --> 00:53:20,000
FALSE
The broken glass thing didn't happen. 
71
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:54,000
TRUE-ISH
Chief Engineer Mike Perry played a huge role in the event, ambushing & capturing the pirate leader single-handedly. This throwing incident wasn't recorded, though. 
72
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:26,000
TRUE-ISH
Muse did go searching for the crew, although he didn't enter the safe room, which was through the engine room & into aft steering. 
73
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:43,000
FALSE-ISH
Although this incident wasn't recorded in the book, we do know that Mike used his knowledge of the ship to capture the pirate leader.
74
00:54:43,000 --> 00:55:07,000
TRUE
As Phillips led Muse around the engine room, Muse grew nervous of the dark & demanded to leave. 
75
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:22,000
FALSE-ISH
Mike certainly had one-to-one dealings with the pirates, but it was Mike who went after the pirate, not vice-versa.
76
00:55:22,000 --> 00:56:43,000
FALSE
The broken glass thing didn't happen. 
77
00:56:43,000 --> 00:57:00,000
TRUE
The pirates were on the bridge, angry that the boat wasn't working. 
78
00:57:00,000 --> 00:58:25,000
TRUE-ISH
Mike alone attacked the pirate leader with a knife, cutting his hand badly. 
79
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:50,000
FALSE
The broken glass thing didn't happen. 
80
00:58:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
TRUE
Mike the chief engineer captured the leader & used him to make a deal.
81
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:38,000
TRUE-ISH
Phillips made this deal with the pirates while the crew had their leader hostage. The pirates were to leave, with the cash, & be given their leader back, in return for Phillips' release. 
82
01:00:38,000 --> 01:01:29,000
TRUE
Phillips did show them the lifeboat, & they awaited the return of their captured leader. 
83
01:01:29,000 --> 01:02:44,000
TRUE-ISH
Phillips had to get into the lifeboat with the pirates to release it, show them how it worked, etc. It was his idea for them to take the lifeboat, they had initially tried another smaller on-board vessel, but the battery had been dead. 
84
01:02:44,000 --> 01:03:50,000
TRUE
The crew released the pirate leader they had caught & he boarded the lifeboat. 
85
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:07,000
TRUE-ISH
Nobody physcially knocked Phillips into the lifeboat - he was already inside. But they did refuse to release him, as had been the deal. 
86
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:49,000
TRUE
The USS Bainbridge assisted the Maersk Alabama, & stayed with Phillips until they were able to rescue him.
87
01:04:49,000 --> 01:05:59,000
TRUE
The USS Bainbridge assisted the Maersk Alabama, & stayed with Phillips until they were able to rescue him.
88
01:05:59,000 --> 01:07:07,000
TRUE-ISH
The lifeboat was hot & cramped. The boy hadn't cut his foot, but there was plenty of complaining on other counts. The leader had been injured when the crew captured him.
89
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:50,000
FALSE
There is no mention of the pirates discussing things like this with Phillips. 
90
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:29,000
TRUE-ISH
The Alabama fired up & started following the lifeboat. When the pirates noticed it was working fine afterall, they were annoyed. They joked about reboarding in the morning to take the ship. 
91
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:51,000
TRUE
The Alabama followed the lifeboat until they were ordered to clear out by the US Navy. 
92
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:37,000
FALSE-ISH
Phillips recalled that after a few days in the lifeboat the pirates fought each other constantly. Phillips did mention khat in his memoir, but only in passing reference. It has to be smoked immediately after harvesting, so no good on an extended journey. 
93
01:09:37,000 --> 01:10:24,000
TRUE-ISH
Although Muse didn't talk to Phillips about this, pirates of the region did claim that foreign trawlers had stolen their fish & dumped hazardous waste in their ocean, undermining their trade as fishermen & leading them to desperate measures. 
94
01:10:24,000 --> 01:12:20,000
TRUE-ISH
The leader had a gashed hand, which he allowed Phillips to clean with the first aid kit. 
95
01:12:20,000 --> 01:13:02,000
TRUE-ISH
Phillips had this knife with him all along. When he opened it to cut the bandage the pirates were surprised, & took it. Not the big event it was made out to be in the film, though. 
96
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:21,000
TRUE
The military were on the case, equipped with a ScanEagle drone.
97
01:13:21,000 --> 01:14:51,000
TRUE
Garaad is known as the 'Pirate King of Somalia'. He claims to be on a mission to stop what he deems illegal international fishing in Somalian waters. His gangs hijack various types of boats, including trawlers, tugs & yachts. 
98
01:14:51,000 --> 01:16:37,000
TRUE
There was plenty of drinking water on the lifeboat, but the pirates rationed Phillips' supply.
99
01:16:37,000 --> 01:17:45,000
FALSE
This incident didn't feature in the book. 
100
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:53,000
TRUE-ISH
Hufan doesn't feature in the book, although we know there was a mothership, & the whole operation was overseen by Garaad, who had a whole hierarchy of men working for him. A Hufan-type character presumably existed. 
101
01:17:53,000 --> 01:19:15,000
FALSE
Garaad is notoriously tough on his men, & expects millions out of the hijackings he funds. 
102
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:47,000
TRUE
The SEAL team worked with the other Navy crews to negotiate for Phillips' release. The White House was aware of the situation, & Obama authorised the use of lethal force in dealing with it. 
103
01:19:47,000 --> 01:21:23,000
TRUE
One pirate tried to smash the plexiglass window with a loaded AK47. Phillips warned the leader what could happen & the leader made the guy take the clip out. 
104
01:21:23,000 --> 01:22:00,000
TRUE
The leader boasted about his previous successes, including a $6m payout. Phillips responded just like in the film.
105
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:35,000
TRUE
Phillips frequently had a gun to his head while on the lifeboat, & the pirates fought each other constantly. 
106
01:22:35,000 --> 01:23:30,000
TRUE
A navy ship arrived in the night, the lights & sirens startling the pirates. It was the USS Bainbridge. 
107
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:38,000
TRUE
Castellano, although not trained in negotiation, was charged with dealing with the pirates. 
108
01:23:38,000 --> 01:24:56,000
TRUE
The Navy had a Somali interpreter. He arranged for food & water to be sent to the lifeboat.
109
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:22,000
TRUE
The Alabama crew wanted to stay with their captain, but the Navy boarded the ship & ordered them to continue on their journey to Mombasa. 
110
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:54,000
TRUE
The Navy did send out a boat with supplies. 
111
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:40,000
We don't have the pirates' side of things.
We don't have the pirates' side of the story. 3 of the 4 were shot dead by Navy SEALS, & the remaining pirate, now in jail, refused to speak to the filmmakers.
112
01:26:40,000 --> 01:27:12,000
TRUE
The Navy did send out a boat with supplies. 
113
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,000
TRUE
The Navy ships were equipped with hi tech gadgets.
114
01:27:18,000 --> 01:28:05,000
TRUE-ISH
Phillips did let his crew know which seat he was in to protect himself from friendly fire. However, he did this via his radio, which, for some reason, the pirates let him keep throughout. 
115
01:28:05,000 --> 01:29:14,000
TRUE
At one point the pirates fired shots next to Phillips' head to torment him. They wanted more than the $30,000 they took, & planned to get millions from the insurance company. 
116
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:29,000
TRUE

01:42:41,000 --> 01:43:01,000
TRUE-ISH
Phillips didn't write about these meaningful moments with the leader, rather, the leader seemed more distant than he was depicted in the film. Still, the pirates did point a gun at Phillips' head & there was a lot of radio contact.
137
01:43:01,000 --> 01:44:32,000
FALSE-ISH
The leader did go onboard to negotiate. The pirates agreed to a tow because they'd drifted off course & were expecting a violent reception from a rival tribe if they landed in the wrong spot. No mention of any ruse using tribal elders.

144
01:49:47,000 --> 01:51:13,000

151

152

157
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:40,000
TRUE
They brought the lifeboat in closer & closer using the towline, so that they could get a better angle for a shot. They didn't have proper sniper rifles on board, so range needed to be short.
