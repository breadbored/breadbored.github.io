7
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:38,000
TRUE
Hunt threw up before every race, regardless of who he was with or where he was. It was part of his pre-race ritual - nobody knows it if was nerves, excitement, or a hangover.

TRUE
Lauda's family didn't mind him tinkering with engines & indulged his hobby, but were angry when they discovered he'd taken part in a race at Muhllacken. His father forbade him from racing ever again. Lauda raced again two weeks later & years of estrangement followed. 
12
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:17,000
TRUE
Lauda was able to get bank loans based on his family name, made plans to use the cash to buy his way in, since he wasn't getting the success needed to pull sponsorship.

TRUE
A helicopter arrived & took Lauda to hospital in Koblenz. His injuries were severe, & included third degree burns, broken ribs, collarbone & cheekbone, & complications from inhalation of toxic fumes.

BRM was broke & didn't have the funds for anything better than tinkering & second-hand parts. 
20
00:16:46,000 --> 00:18:08,000
FALSE-ISH
This sort-of happened at Ferrari, not BRM. Lauda told Mr. Ferrari that his car had too much understeer. Mr. Ferrari responded that Lauda had one week to lose a second from his lap time or he was out. Lauda modified the car & delivered, calling it 'a piece of cake, actually'. 
21
00:18:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
TRUE
BRM offered Lauda a 2yr contract once they got wind of Ferrari's interest in the driver, hoping to tie him down. In the end, Ferrari paid off Lauda's contract & other debts to secure him for their team. Pretty much everybody Lauda ever spoke to was affronted in some way. 
22
00:19:11,000 --> 00:20:34,000
FALSE
Lauda had a serious girlfriend (Mariella Reininghaus) for years before meeting Marlene, who he married. He wasn't dating at this point. Although Hunt was a promiscuous fellow with swathes of female admirers, so he may well have dated the BRM track manager. 
23
00:20:34,000 --> 00:21:58,000
TRUE

25
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:32,000
TRUE-ISH
The crash killed American driver Mark Donohue. Hunt threw up before every race, regardless of who he was with or where he was. It was part of his pre-race ritual. Whether or not he threw up at the exact moment he learnt of Donohue's death is unknown. 
26
00:23:32,000 --> 00:24:10,000
FALSE-ISH
Hunt was the more emotional of the pair, & Lauda was brutally honest, not afraid to air his views - such a scene isn't unlikely. Still, this moment wasn't in the Calley book. 
27
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:32,000
This moment isn't in the Calley book. 
It's pretty likely Hunt imagined his races by way of preparation, although this scene isn't in Calley's book. 
28
00:24:32,000 --> 00:26:52,000
TRUE-ISH
Hunt met Suzy while both were in Spain. They dated on & off, him resisting the commitment she wanted from him. Eventually he half-heartedly proposed.
29
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:23,000
TRUE
Hunt & Suzy were married in a lavish ceremony, paid for by Lord Hesketh. Hunt regretted his proposal & didn't want to go through with the wedding, but felt he couldn't let so many people down.

31
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:24,000
TRUE
Ferrari had the money & set-up, but hadn't won in years when Lauda joined. The cars weren't up to scratch, but the team owner wouldn't hear of it. Lauda confronted him in his usual foul language & was met with a threat. Ultimately though the cars were improved.
32
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:36,000
TRUE
Regazzoni walked out of BRM to join Ferrari, & told them Lauda should be his teammate. Ferrari had noticed Lauda's strong performances in weak cars & headhunted him, paying off his contract with BRM so he could join the team. 
33
00:28:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
TRUE
Lauda & Regazzoni always had a good relationship.

00:37:39,000 --> 00:40:03,000
TRUE-ISH
Although Lauda was a great test driver & knew a lot about cars, he didn't design the suspension as suggested in the film. He had a lot of mechanical input in general, though.

TRUE
Team Hesketh folded when the money ran out. 
42
00:40:33,000 --> 00:41:53,000
TRUE
Lord Hesketh had initally hoped to avoid sponsorship at all, citing it as crude. Still, in dire straits he chased Â£300,000 of sponsorship cash the team needed to stay afloat, to no avail. The team fell apart. 
43
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:30,000
TRUE
Following his most successful F1 season & first victory, financial disaster meant Hunt found himself with no car & no team.

47
00:45:16,000 --> 00:46:27,000
TRUE
McLaren took Hunt on.
48
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:51,000
TRUE
McLaren boss Teddy Mayer certainly did find Hunt to be a loose cannon, & was embarrased by his antics. Still, Hunt was a winner & did well with McLaren. 
49
00:46:51,000 --> 00:48:01,000
TRUE
Hunt & Lauda were both top of their game, & remained each other's only true competitors throughout the season. 
50
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:14,000
TRUE

55
00:51:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
TRUE
McLaren repositioned the oil coolers to bring the car back in-line with regulations, but the modifications were disastrous. Lauda was partially to blame for Hunt's disqualification - he appeared in court to give evidence against him. 
56
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:21,000
TRUE
Hunt's marriage to Suzy Miller broke down following her affair with Richard Burton in 1976. 
57
00:53:21,000 --> 00:54:57,000
TRUE
Suzy finally left Hunt for Burton, but they had been privately estranged for some time & the split came as a relief to Hunt.
58
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:37,000
TRUE
When questioned by the press about Suzy's affair he shrugged it off & claimed the Grand Prix had his full focus. After meeting with his wife in New York, he dropped her off at Burton's hotel, heightening the scandal. 
59
00:55:37,000 --> 00:56:34,000
TRUE

62
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:28,000
TRUE
The FIA heard Hunt's case & decided to revoke the disqualification on the grounds that an extra 1.8cm width would not have given him an unfair advantage. The decision propelled Hunt forwards, giving him an additional 9 points for the season. 
63
00:58:28,000 --> 00:59:03,000
TRUE-ISH
Hunt & Lauda were both arrogant & self-assured, but this piece of dialogue isn't in Calley's book. 
64
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:36,000
TRUE

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:59,000
FALSE-ISH
Little is known about Lauda & Marlene's wedding, it was done in secret & came as a surprise to the public. Lauda wasn't into extravagance in any aspect of his life.
66
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:20,000
TRUE
Lauda & Marlene were very close.
67
01:00:20,000 --> 01:01:30,000
FALSE-ISH
Lauda & Marlene were, & continue to be, very private people. Details like this aren't known. Lauda recently said of his latest marriage, 'I want to protect my private life & not carry it out in detail as Boris Becker does.'
68
01:01:30,000 --> 01:02:14,000

There's no record of a fan saying this to Lauda, although he signed plenty of autographs. 
70
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:58,000
TRUE
The Nurburgring track in Germany is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. & it was drenched that day.
71
01:02:58,000 --> 01:05:40,000
TRUE-ISH
Lauda wasn't always so risk-averse, but a bad accident at Zolder spurred him to take a safer, analytical approach to racing. Lauda did call a meeting before the race, insisting that the track & conditions were too dangerous. He was outvoted by one. Hunt didn't sway the vote though. The majority of the drivers wanted to race.
72
01:05:40,000 --> 01:07:26,000
TRUE
All the drivers bar one, Jochen Mass, started the race on wet weather tyres.

74
01:08:37,000 --> 01:09:59,000
TRUE
The drivers stopped to change their tyres, giving Jochen Mass, who'd picked the right tyres in the first place, a significant lead. Lauda hit the track desperate to catch Hunt. 
75
01:09:59,000 --> 01:12:25,000
TRUE
Lauda's Ferrari hit the banking just before the Bergwerk corner & burst into flames. The three drivers he collided with, Guy Edwards, Harold Ertl & Brett Lunger, all stopped & tried to drag Lauda from the burning car.
76
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:19,000
TRUE
A German newspaper photographed Lauda in a coma, & ran the headline 'My God, Where Is His Face?'. 
77
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:44,000
TRUE
During the week following the accident, a priest visited to give him the last rites. The build up of fluid in Lauda's lungs was so dangerous that nobody thought he would survive.
78
01:13:44,000 --> 01:14:28,000
TRUE
Hunt reported that he felt totally hopeless following the accident, but sent Lauda a provocative telegram, hoping to spark his fighting spirit. 
79
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:52,000
TRUE
Marlene went straight to the hospital before she even knew which of the 28 drivers had crashed. Lauda woke up against all expectations. She remained with him through his recovery. 
80
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:28,000
TRUE
Lauda had some reconstruction & numerous skin grafts, but severe scarring & deformation remained. Marlene fainted when she first saw his face after the accident.
81
01:15:28,000 --> 01:16:18,000
TRUE
Lauda watched Grand Prix races from his hospital bed, including the Austrian Grand Prix, which was almost cancelled out of respect for Lauda. 
82
01:16:18,000 --> 01:17:53,000
TRUE
Lauda's lungs were so badly damaged they had to be vacuumed. He was in such a terrible state that his doctors put his survival down to pure will. 
83
01:17:53,000 --> 01:19:04,000
TRUE-ISH
We don't know much about the private moments between Marlene & Lauda, but he has said the pain of the crash helmet was 'unbearable', & his wounds seeped through his balaclava during his first post-accident race at Monza. 
84
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:41,000
TRUE
Lauda only missed two races of that season, returning to race at Monza 6 weeks after the priest gave him last rites. He was still wrapped in bandages, which were bloodsoaked by the end of the race.
85
01:19:41,000 --> 01:21:05,000
FALSE
Hunt had no part to play in Lauda's accident. While the film showed Hunt persuading the majority of the drivers to go ahead with the race that day, in reality, it was a close call that Lauda lost by one vote.
86
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:59,000
FALSE
Although Hunt did have reputation for being wild, this incident isn't on record. Hunt's son Tom has said it was possible, though - 'that's the way dad was'.
87
01:23:59,000 --> 01:25:54,000

A reporter at a press conference did ask Lauda if he thought his marriage would survive his facial disfigurement, & whether he planned to have plastic surgery. Lauda reacted angrily, stating he did not care how he looked. 
90
01:28:24,000 --> 01:29:30,000
TRUE-ISH
Lauda's return to the track was seen as heroic by contemporaries, particularly as he was seen peeling blood soaked bandages from raw wounds afterwards. He wasn't lifted by the crowd, though. 
91
01:29:30,000 --> 01:30:15,000
TRUE
The weather was horrendous on that day, the rain so heavy there were streams running across the track. Many were concerned & some drivers wanted the race cancelled. 
92
01:30:15,000 --> 01:31:28,000
TRUE
Hunt was a nervous driver with a crippling fear of failure, but always outwardly confident, while Lauda took a calm, matter-of-fact approach to racing - nothing much scared him.
93
01:31:28,000 --> 01:32:21,000

At the time F1 races were rarely televised in the UK, but the Japan Mount Fuji race was due to be shown live on October 24th, 1976.

TRUE
Hunt & Lauda respected one another a great deal, & admired each other's skill. 
97
01:34:52,000 --> 01:38:02,000
TRUE
The spray virtually blinded Lauda. His eyelids were so badly burnt he struggled to blink, & his damaged tear ducts caused excessive watering. He pulled in, prioritising his safety. 
98
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:36,000
TRUE
The Ferrari team were all over the car, anxious to find out what was wrong. Lauda filled them in. 
99
01:38:36,000 --> 01:39:08,000
TRUE
The Ferrari team were willing to blame Lauda's exit on a mechanical issue, but he insisted on the truth. 3 other drivers pulled out for safety reasons during the race. 
100
01:39:08,000 --> 01:40:42,000
TRUE
Hunt failed to pull in for tyre changes, hoping to gain on the other drivers as they did so. By the time he finally entered the pitstop his tyres had disintegrated. 
101
01:40:42,000 --> 01:42:02,000
FALSE-ISH
Hunt was furious that his team had messed up his tyre strategy, costing him precious time. It took 27 seconds to change all 4 tyres. No record of them suggesting he give up, though.

TRUE
The pit board was faulty & as Hunt finished the race, he had no idea he had won the championship.
103
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:53,000

TRUE
Hunt insisted on examining the race charts himself, before accepting his win. 
105
01:45:49,000 --> 01:46:42,000
TRUE
Today, Lauda says he would not have changed anything, has no regrets. He claims it was stupid for anybody to race that day. He only did the single lap he completed so that Ferrari would get their money. 
106
01:46:42,000 --> 01:47:40,000
TRUE
Unlike Lauda the year before, Hunt achieved celebrity status with his championship victory, & partied hard in the aftermath. 
107
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:56,000
FALSE-ISH

Hunt & Lauda were good friends, & respected one another. Hunt described Lauda as fair & tough. Hunt became a broadcaster for the BBC. Lauda became world champion for the last time in 1984, his third championship.
