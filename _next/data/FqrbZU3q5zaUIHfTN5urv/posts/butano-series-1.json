You can find installation instructions for all three platforms on the [DevKitPro website](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).\n\n#### Software\n\n##### Development Tools\n\n- [DevKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started), our toolchain for building GBA homebrew\n  - Once installed, install the `gba-dev` package.\n    - Windows:\n        This is done through the GUI installer. Choose the `gba-dev` package from the list. If you forgot to install it, you can re-run the installer to add it\n    - MacOS / Linux terminal:\n      - Most systems: `dkp-pacman -S gba-dev`\n      - Some distros using vanilla pacman: `pacman -S gba-dev`\n- [mGBA](https://mgba.io/downloads.html), an emulator for testing our GBA homebrew.\n  - Supports GDB debugging as well for breakpoints and memory inspection.\n- `git`, for version control\n  - Windows: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)\n    - For the remainder of this tutorial, you will be using the Git Bash terminal so that the commands match those shown for MacOS and Linux.\n  - MacOS: Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install git`, or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)\n  - Linux: Install via your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install git` on Debian-based systems\n\nSome flavorful alternatives for the experienced reader who wants to explore beyond the scope of this tutorial:\n\n- Toolchains:\n  - [Wonderful Toolchain](https://wonderful.asie.pl/), an alternative GBA homebrew toolchain supported by Butano.\n    - For Windows & Linux only!\n- Emulators:\n  - [VisualBoyAdvance-M (VBA-M)](https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m), a popular alternative emulator for GBA homebrew development.\n    - It supports debugging with gdb like mGBA, which is very useful\n  - [Mesen](https://mesen.ca/), an alternative emulator that supports GBA, has a color mode that more closely matches the original screen, and has a great debugger.\n\nFinally, you will need a code editor. This is the most highly subjective part of the setup, so I will leave it up to you. \n\nIf you are a beginner, don't use a basic text editor or an IDE that requires extensive configuration unless you really know what you're doing. Beginners will fall into the trap of simple text editors or misconfigurations, and run into errors they don't know how to debug. IDEs are designed to help you with debugging and code management. Experienced developers may prefer text editors or highly configurable IDEs, but they also know how to debug issues that arise from using them.\n\nI have included configurations for the following editors in the repository:\n\n|**Editor**|**Pros**|**Cons**|**Notes**|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)|Supports every OS<br/>Free and open source<br/>Extensive plugin ecosystem<br/>Supports many languages and frameworks<br/>Supports GDB debugging with the right extensions<br/>Integrated git support|Can be resource-intensive with many extensions<br/>Built on Electron and Chromium, which comes with its own set of trade-offs|Popular choice|\n|[Zed](https://zed.dev/)|Free and open source<br/>Fast and modern features<br/>Built on Rust for memory safety<br/>Good language support<br/>Integrated git support|Newer IDE with a smaller ecosystem|I like it a lot.

I have bought this software 3 times across different computers because I use it so much.\n  - [Aseprite (source)](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/releases), the open source version of Aseprite that you can compile yourself.\n    - Lacks some features of the paid version, but still very capable.\n  - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), a free and open source image editor.\n    - More general-purpose than Aseprite, but can be used for pixel art as well.\n  - [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), another free and open source image editor.\n    - Also more general-purpose, but has good support for pixel art.\n\n- Audio Assets Options:\n  - [OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org/)\\*, a free and open source tracker for creating music.\n    - Supports exporting to formats compatible with GBA homebrew.\n    - Windows \"only\" software, but can be run on MacOS & Linux with Wine (requires `wine`).\n      - MacOS\n        - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already with `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"`\n        - Run `brew install --cask wine-stable` to install Wine.\n      - Linux\n        - Install Wine via your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install wine` on Debian-based systems.\n  - [Furnace Tracker](https://tildearrow.org/furnace/), a free and open source tracker designed for chiptune music.\n    - Cross-platform and lightweight.\n    - \"Supports\" making GBA music, but the only format it can export that is compatible is VGM, which means you can only make Game Boy / Color music. Luckily, the GBA is backwards compatible with GB/C audio, but you cannot take advantage of the GBA's 2 PCM channels.\n      - This could be a misunderstanding on my part; please correct me if I'm wrong!\n\n### Getting the starter repository\n\nFrom here on out, if you are on Windows, \"terminal\" means the Git-Bash terminal. It is important to use Git-Bash because many commands will not work correctly in Command Prompt or PowerShell.\n\nOpen your terminal, navigate to your desired directory, and run the following commands to clone the starter repository and navigate into it:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository and navigate into it\ngit clone https://github.com/breadbored/butano-tutorial-series.git butano-tutorial-series\ncd butano-tutorial-series\n\n# Initialize git submodules, which includes Butano itself and an extension for Fonts\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\nIn this directory you will find:\n\n```text\nbutano-tutorial-series/\n├─ chapter-1-getting-started/   - Our starting point for this series\n├─ .gitignore\n├─ LICENSE\n├─ README.md\n```\n\nYou can follow along with the tutorial series in its entirety by using the `chapter-1-getting-started` directory as your starting point, and work in that directory (or copy that directory elsewhere) for the duration of the series. The other directories are provided for reference. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be working in the `chapter-1-getting-started` directory.\n\n```bash\ncd chapter-1-getting-started\n```\n\nNow let's build and run our starter project to ensure everything is working correctly.\n\n```bash\nmake\n```\n\nTo start the game in mGBA (without debugging with gdb) you can run:\n\n```bash\nmake run\n```\n\nOnce you see the mGBA window pop up with our starter project running, congratulations! Your development environment is set up correctly!\n\n### What's Next?\n\nNext we will begin working with assets in Butano. This includes creating and importing sprites, backgrounds, and audio into our project. We will also explore ways to use those assets.\n\n### Chapter Overview\n\n###### ButanoSeriesNav \"1\",\"1\"\n\n---\n---\n\n### Communities\n\n#### Discord\n\n- Please remember this is ***not my server***, so do not dominate the conversation with questions about this series.

This will begin with introductions, then getting our environment setup, and then we will move into building a simple game over the course of several chapters.\n\nIf you'd like to skip introductions and get straight to the setup, you can jump to [Chapter 1](/posts/butano-series-1).\n\n### About Me\n\nMy name is Brad, aka \"Bread\" (as the baristas at coffee shops often call me). I am a hobbyist of many things. Professionally I am a Lead Data Engineer, though most of my experience was in Backend Software Engineering and Database Administration. My favorite language overall is SQL, because I love data transformation and declarative puzzles. My favorite imperative language is probably Rust, though there's such a small gap between Rust and C++ that it's hard to say definitively.\n\n18 years ago I was gifted Mario Galaxy for the Nintendo Wii, and I was so blown away by the physics of a planetary system that 11 year old me wanted ***nothing*** more than to do that myself. Not just on PC, but on the Wii itself. I remember the day I published my first project for PC: March 14th 2009. My goal was always homebrew for consoles, but I wouldn't start seriously pursing that as my primary hobby until around COVID-19 in 2020.\n\n### Intended Audience\n\nWhile I will try to keep things as beginner-friendly as possible, I will be writing for an audience that has at least a basic understanding of C++ and minimal game development concepts. Butano is less of a game engine and more of a framework for asset management. As you'll come to find in this series, Butano simplifies most - but not all - aspects of developing a game for the Game Boy Advance.\n\nThis is intended for people who are interested in the hobby and it is supposed to be a fun use of your time. This series is for people who are driven by the high of making cool stuff.\n\nGame Dev - and especially Homebrew Game Dev - is largely art, so I want to make this clear sooner rather than later: the use of GenAI tools is discouraged. I know people - including myself - are opinionated on the subject. The use of GenAI is not allowed in GBA Game Jams, and I feel that this is a good standard to uphold for learning and hobby purposes. Not only is this supposed to be fun, but copyright infringement is a valid concern for artists.\n\n### What We Will Be Building\n\nOver the course of this series, we will be building a simple puzzle game based on [Klotski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski), which is often referred to as \"sliding block puzzle.\" The goal of the game is to move - as I call it - \"inconveniently\" arranged rectangular blocks, which impede each other's paths, to free the target block. I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLNyHd2w10) about Klotski for a handful of reasons, only one of which is relevant to this series (how the game works). This game will lay a great foundation for understanding Butano's core features, game loops, entity management, collision, and other game development concepts. For Butano specifically, we'll cover the following major features:\n\n- Sprites\n  - Regular\n  - Affine\n  - Fonts\n- Backgrounds\n  - Regular\n  - Affine\n  - Tiles\n- Inputs\n- Audio\n  - Music\n  - Sound Effects\n\n### Chapter Overview\n\n###### ButanoSeriesNav 0\n\n---\n\n### Communities\n\n#### Discord\n\n- Please remember this is ***not my server***, so do not dominate the conversation with questions about this series.
