There is a patch after 24H2 that adds the ability to use the camera in multiple applications at once, which is required for the MKWorld Toolkit to work with OBS.\n\nInstructions with images can be found [here](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/enable-or-disable-multiple-apps-to-use-camera-in-windows-11.31199/).\n\n- Open Windows 11 Settings with `Win + I`.\n- Go to \"***Bluetooth & devices***\"\n- Click \"***Cameras***\"\n- Under ***Connected cameras*** , click on the capture card (e.g. \"MiraBox\") you want to change this setting for.\n- Click on the ***Edit*** button for ***Advanced camera options***.\n- Turn `on` or `off` ***Allow multiple apps to use camera at the same time*** for what you want, and click on Apply.\n\n[Continue to setup instructions](#setup-instructions-for-all-platforms).\n\n<!-- ## MacOS\n\n### Pre-Setup Instructions (MacOS)\n\nThe app is unsigned because an Apple Developer account is $99/year, so you will need to allow the app to run in your security settings.\n\n- Open System Settings.\n- Go to \"***Privacy & Security***\".\n- Scroll down to the \"***Security***\" section.\n- Click on the \"***Allow***\" button next to the \"***MKWorld Toolkit*** app.\n\n[Continue to setup instructions](#setup-instructions-for-all-platforms).\n\n## Linux\n\n### Debian / Ubuntu / Debian-based Distros\n\nAll good :D\n\n[Continue to setup instructions](#setup-instructions-for-all-platforms).\n\n### Others\n\nWait until the source is available... I am refactoring the code on a daily basis until I'm happy with architecture, and it is subject to change frequently. I can't reasonably maintain a complex CI/CD pipeline while the code and dependencies are in flux.\n\n[Continue to setup instructions](#setup-instructions-for-all-platforms). -->\n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions for All Platforms\n\n### Download\n\n- v0.0.5 (latest)\n    - [Windows Download](https://github.com/breadbored/breadbored.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.5/MKWorld.Toolkit_0.0.5_x64-setup.exe)\n    <!-- - MacOS\n        - [Intel/x86_64 Download]()\n        - [Apple Silicon/ARM Download]()\n    - Linux\n        - [Linux (.deb)]() -->\n    - Changes:\n        - HUGE performance improvements\n        - Attempt History and Export\n        - Better capture card support\n        - 90% of bugs reported have been fixed\n- v0.0.4\n    - [Windows Download](https://github.com/breadbored/breadbored.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.4/MKWorld.Toolkit_0.0.4_x64-setup.exe)\n    - Changes:\n        - Added support for Elgato HD60 series capture cards\n        - Added support for YUV2 2-byte pixel format\n        - Added support for 4k capture cards\n- v0.0.3\n    - [Windows Download](https://github.com/breadbored/breadbored.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.3/MKWorld.Toolkit_0.0.3_x64-setup.exe)\n    - Changes:\n        - Added \"Data Consent\" dialog for optional error reporting\n            - This is ***optional*** and ***off by default***, but if enabled, helps me resolve issues in the app faster and easier for everyone.
