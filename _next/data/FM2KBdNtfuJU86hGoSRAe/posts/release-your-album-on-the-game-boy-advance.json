TrackPak is a tool that converts your tracker music to an album that runs entirely on the Game Boy Advance.\n\nTrackPak supports several customization options such as fonts, color schemes, and additional details about you and your music.\n\n[Want to try it now?](/album)\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThrough the magic of Duct Tape and Prayers™, it's really just two parts:\n\n- A Butano `base/` project that handles the UI and music management\n- an Express server that generates a C header for the `base/` project, and starts the `make` process\n\nThat's literally it. Due to it's simplicity, I'll be releasing a standalone tool as well in the near future along with the `base/` project that does all the foundational music and UI management.","categories":["miniproject","media","tracker","music","game boy","gameboy","gba","game boy advance"],"skeets":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
