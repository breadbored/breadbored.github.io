Philomena visited the abbey several times over the years, looking for her son, beginning the year he left. Each time they told her they had heard nothing, although on one occasion he had been there just three weeks previously.

Jane Russell was one of many wealthy Americans who bought babies from Britain - she adopted a son from a Derry couple living in London. London produced passports for these babies no questions asked. It caused a scandal, & Russell had to fight to keep the child. While there wasn't officially a set fee, a 'donation' of a specific amount was recommended. The 'fire' at the abbey was indeed a bonfire set by Sister Hildegard in 1989, when she became worried after people started asking questions. She later confessed to destroying the records.
