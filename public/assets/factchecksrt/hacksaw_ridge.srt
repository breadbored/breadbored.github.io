3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
TRUE
It feels like a fairly true-to-life portrayal of war, albeit a little heavy on the balletic trajectory of the dying soldiers.


4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
TRUE
Doss did speak with quite a broad accent & he certainly was obsessed with the bible.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

5
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
TRUE
Doss was repeatedly injured in battle. On this one occasion, he had 17 pieces of shrapnel in his "legs & buttocks" & a smashed arm. (Plus he got TB in Leyte & later lost a lung.)

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
TRUE-ISH
Doss was brought up in Lynchburg, Virginia, but the film was actully shot in Australia.

7
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
TRUE
Doss & his brother did spend a lot of time in the outdoors, gadding about.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

8
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Not documented but not unreasonable. 
There's no evidence that this scene ever took place but it's certainly possible. Doss's father was an alcoholic & may have had a reputation for being a little crazy.


9
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Undocumented but not impossible. 
No one could possibly know if this scene ever took place. It's not impossible.


10
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Cheesy & unconfirmable but possible. 
It's possible that this took place although much more likely that this is dramatic licence of the rather overblown variety.


11
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
TRUE-ISH
Hal confirms in interviews that they certainly fought a lot. The picture of family life completely erases Audrey Doss, however, who was two years older than Desmond.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

12
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,000
FALSE
Hal says that they stopped fighting after one occasion when Doss landed on his head, but it had nothing to do with Doss swearing off violence.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

13
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:48,000
FALSE
The fight never took place. It was actually a fight between his father & his uncle that made Doss swear never to touch a gun again.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

14
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:21,000
FALSE-ISH
Although the religious picture existed & was said to have had a big influence on Doss, this scene did not take place, because Doss never knocked his brother out with a brick.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

15
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:13,000
FALSE-ISH
Although Doss's mother tutored Doss in the ways of religious righteousness, she did not have this conversation with him in the context of Doss hitting his brother with a brick, because it never happened.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

16
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is undocumented.
We know that Doss's father was often drunk & despondent, but the extent of his drunken behaviour is undocumented.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

17
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Might have happened, but nobody knows for sure.
Doss never spoke of this incident & it's not the kind of thing he would talk about but something similar may well have happened.


18
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
TRUE
Doss & his mum loved church, & fifteen years had definitely elapsed.
Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

19
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
TRUE
Both Doss & his mother were heavily involved with church activites so this scene, or something similar, is pretty likely to have taken place.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

20
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
FALSE
This incident never occurred. In the film it's just a way of setting up Doss's meeting with his future wife & his burgeoning interest in medicine.

24

25
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
FALSE
Doss & Dorothy actually met in church & she didn't train as a nurse until years later, long after the war.
Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

26
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:08,000
FALSE
They met in church when she was selling books. They did not meet in hospital.
Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

27
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:24,000
FALSE-ISH
To be totally fair, Doss did walk a long way on more than one occasion to give blood when it was required, but he didn't give it to Dorothy because Dorothy wasn't a nurse.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

28
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,000
FALSE
Even if this scene had taken place (which it never did), Doss seeing Dorothy's name on the book reeks of cinematic contrivance.

Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

29
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,000
TRUE
Doss told the Veterans' History Project: "Always from my childhood on I wished I could be a doctor, a minister or a missionary." He was also a big fan of nature.
The Veterans' History Project

30
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Not possible to confirm this. 
Although the timing is all wrong & the main conversation is very reminiscent of a scene in The Graduate, it's possible that this conversation took place. We will, however, never know for sure.


31
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:07,000
May have happened. Impossible to know. 
Although this is almost certainly a scriptwriter's contrivance & there is no record of the feather incident, strictly speaking it remains unknown.


32
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
There is no record of this.
Again, it feels like a totally fake scene (and Dorothy did not work at a hospital), but in truth, we have no way of knowing.


33
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:08,000
FALSE
Doss must have asked Dorothy out at some stage but it never happened in hospital because Dorothy was not yet a nurse.
History vs. Hollywood

34
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:51,000
TRUE-ISH
To give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt, Doss & Dorothy almost certainly went to the cinema where they will have seen government war propaganda.

Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

35
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:44,000

Doss kissed Dorothy for the first time on a double-date with another Seventh Day Adventist couple in Washington.
Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

36
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:53,000
FALSE
Hal didn't join up until a couple of years later, in the winter of 1943.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

37
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Probably not but we can't say for sure. 
If it happened, it's highly unlikely anyone would know about it, but equally, we can't say for sure that it didn't happen. (Although it definitely didn't happen in hospital.)


38
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Maybe. Maybe not. Unconfirmed. Unconfirmable. 
This is just a scene imagined by the scriptwriters, but it may have happened. You never know.


39
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:19,000
TRUE-ISH
Just a little filler scene to show Doss moving into his life as a medic. May have happened. Quite probable that it did.

Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

40
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:47,000
FALSE-ISH
As we've established, Dorothy was not yet a nurse, so this scene never happened. However, they did become engaged at some point & it seems reasonable that Dorothy would have been upset at the idea of Doss going to war.

Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

41
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000

There is no record of this conversation happening & the names of Tom Doss's dead friends are untraceable.

42
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Again, there is no record of this. 
This conversation is unconfirmed.


43
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:11,000
TRUE-ISH
Dorothy almost certainly saw Doss off to basic training, & she did give him a bible, but later, when they got married.
The Veterans' History Project

44
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:43,000
TRUE
Doss did head for Fort Jackson & it seems only reasonable that he would have had a photograph of Dorothy.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

45
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
TRUE
Doss did definitely stay in a barracks at Fort Jackson.

Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

46
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:38,000

Although the barracks were true, the naked man is almost certainly an invention.

47
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:25,000
TRUE-ISH
Although it's true that Doss did meet the other men in his unit, they have been renamed in the film, & Smitty is a composite character, an amalgamation of those that picked on Doss.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

48
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,000
FALSE
Although it is possible that Doss was taunted with pornography, there is no record of this & we can't just keep giving the film the benefit of the doubt, so this is marked as false.

Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

49
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:44,000
FALSE-ISH
The original script contains far fewer downright falsehoods, this scene being one of them. Rather, this is just *that scene* that every army film must have. Something similar may have happened, but it isn't based on actual events.
Original Hacksaw Ridge script

50
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:25,000

Even if Smitty had existed, it is highly unlikely that this scene would ever have taken place.

No record of this exchange.
It's not impossible that something of this nature took place but it is not recorded anywhere.


52
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:03,000
TRUE-ISH
The naked soldier is an invention, probably inspired by Catch 22. The men, however, will certainly have been ordered outside.

Doss first discovered how to make a two-looped knot by accident whilst training in West Virginia.
Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

54
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:34,000

Doss & others from his unit talk about how much Doss was persecuted by many of the other men. Just not by Smitty, who didn't exist.

55
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:53,000

Doss was deliberately assigned to a rifle company in the hopes that he'd quit, but he didn't & did indeed refuse to touch a gun.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

56
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:25,000

Although this scene is not specifically recounted, there is enough anecdotal evidence of widespread ridicule for it to be possible. Especially at the hands of officers & top brass.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

59
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000

Doss was repeatedly mocked & abused throughout training so scenes of this nature are likely to have taken place.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

60
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:02,000

Doss was called before a psychiatric board in Arizona, not at Fort Jackson. There will have been a discussion about Doss's religion.
The Veterans' History Project

62
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:58,000
TRUE-ISH
It was officially decreed that Doss could not be declared unfit to serve on account of his religion. Just the personnel involved & the location were different. Glover did want rid of him, however.
The Veterans' History Project
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

64
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:21,000

Doss spent a lot of time cleaning toilets, especially after he returned from praying during the Sabbath. He was punished for his religion.

65
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:16,000

In interviews, Doss has said that "no one could have a pass" because of Doss's own insistence on not working on the Sabbath, so there is certainly an element of truth in this.
The Veterans' History Project

66
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:47,000
FALSE
There is much anecdotal evidence of the abuse & ridicule Doss received, but as far as actual beating is concerned, nobody has spoken out.
The Conscientious Objector: The Story of an American Hero (2004)

67
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
There are no accounts of this.
Nobody from Doss's regiment has spoken of this, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.


68
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:09,000

Doss never spoke of being beaten & although the dialogue in this scene is not very good, no one can say for sure that the scene never took place.

In reality, it was a Colonel Cunningham who ordered Doss to pick up a rifle & then threatened him with a court martial & it happened when they were stationed in Pennsylvania. True enough.

70

01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:16,000
FALSE-ISH
Having retreated under bombardment, Doss & two other men set up the cargo nets themselves on the second day. It seems the film was already too lost in its own tangled web of garbled chronology & alternative facts to include this.
Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

95
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:06,000
FALSE
The first assault on the ridge was not hampered by lack of visibility. The smoke from the mortar bombardment was not there because the bombardment didn't happen.
Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

96
01:13:51,000 --> 01:14:01,000

It probably didn't happen quite like this, but they did go up the mountain & there was a lot of intense fighting.

97
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:14,000

This is something that could happen of course, but any stories that feature Smitty (who didn't exist) must be treated with suspicion.

98
01:15:51,000 --> 01:16:01,000

There is of course the possibility that something very close to this did occur, but because of the fact that Smitty didn't actually, we have to mark it false.

Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

99
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:07,000
TRUE
A soldier with head & chest wounds & his legs blown off was left to die by Ralph Baker (not Herb Schechter), but Doss treated him anyway, believing, "As long as there's life, there's always hope." The man survived & lived to be 72.

Ghoul aka Andy Walker does not appear to have existed, but a scene of this kind could very easily have happened. Ah go on. Benefit of the doubt.

101
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:50,000

It's not known how many times Doss had to insist that this man be helped, but we know there was resistance, & he did insist, & the man did live.

Redemption at Hacksaw Ridge (2016) by B. Herndon

105
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:33,000

The fact that there are no tales of anyone using a body to quench a grenade, added to the fact that Smitty didn't exist, equals a verdict of 'false' for this one.

Although Ghoul didn't actually exist, Doss did save a lot of people, so it would be churlish to completely deny the truth of his valour in this scene just because Ghoul is a composite character.

Doss promised God he wouldn't touch a gun again after his father threatened his brother-in-law, not his mother as Doss claims. (Plus Smitty didn't exist.)

American soldiers were pushed back again & again over a number of days. The Japanese deliberately allowed them inland & then attacked, over & over. This was not portrayed particularly accurately in the film.

Doss confirms that he was communing with God constantly, so this seems totally reasonable.

01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Impossible to say. 
It's possible that this happened at some point.

It's this one night of effort for which Doss is mostly famous.

122
01:42:50,000 --> 01:43:00,000

Without enough rope to do it the normal way, Doss remembered his training in West Virginia & used the double-loop technique.

123
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:15,000
He could have. It's not clear. 
There is no record of this, but it's not unlikely. It happened frequently. Artillery strikes were planned & then called off when things didn't go according to plan. It's not mentioned in any of the accounts of the battle though.


124
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:55,000
There is no record of this. 
Doss does not mention this in any of his interviews so it seems unlikely to have taken place, but strictly speaking, we cannot say for sure that it was totally made up.


125
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Hmmmmmm....
This isn't very likely — especially as it was never subsequently mentioned — but you never know.

This will have happened frequently.

Doss did spend one night in a cave, but he was with another soldier & probably didn't avoid quite so many Japanese soldiers quite so narrowly.

131
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:24,000

Doss speaks of being threatened by American soldiers on one occasion for treating an injured enemy soldier, & Japanese soldiers were discovered with US bandages on them, so it's quite likely he lowered one or two. Also quite likely they wouldn't make it.

132

He wasn't badly injured until a couple of weeks after this event. (And when it did happen, when Doss was stretchered off to hospital, apparently he crawled off the litter to tend to another wounded man, then was shot again & had to crawl to safety.)

This is another major conflation of stories. Grover did change his opinion about Doss. On this occasion, however, it was Captain Vernon who asked Doss to break the Sabbath for the men, as he was the only medic left. Also, this happened 4 days after last night's battle.

Doss prayed for Company B on the second day in Okinawa & on that occasion, after he prayed, not one man died. (Why this wasn't in the film is anyone's guess.) On this occasion, the attack was delayed while Doss finished doing his own private devotions.

Something similar to this happened in Guam, after which they were told to ignore white flags. On another occasion on Okinawa, Doss picked up a live hand grenade & threw it. The two stories have been conflated rather dramatically.
