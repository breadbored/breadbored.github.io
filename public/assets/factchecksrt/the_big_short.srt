The quote used has a similar meaning to the Tolstoy quote that originally prefaces the book the film is based on. The (long & wordy) Tolstoy quote was in the original screenplay, but was dropped. The quote probably refers to the ignorance in the housing market.

Burry set up Scion Capital  with funds from a payout his family got after misdiagnosis played a part in his father's death. He was certainly eccentric, & always felt himself to be different.

Because Burry didn't charge the usual 2% fee to his clients, he had to cover his shortfall by firing his staff while he waited for his bet to come good. Indeed, he did scream f*** at the top of his voice at this point.
