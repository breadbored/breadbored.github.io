TRUE
Lion was filmed on location Ganesh Talai & West Bengal.
IMDB

4
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
TRUE-ISH
Lion is definitely based on a true story. Just how closely we're about to find out. The landscape in which Saroo grew up is the same as in this scene, & in the book of his life, Saroo talks about chasing butterflies, if not quite standing amongst them in this fashion.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

5
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
TRUE
Saroo & his brother certainly spent time out & about, although not that much, as they had a middle brother, Kallu, who was closer to Guddu in age, & usually Saroo was left at home with his younger sister.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

6
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
FALSE-ISH
This is never mentioned in the book & it's the kind of thing Saroo would have mentioned, particularly if it had happened on this very special day. Life was hard, however, & they did have to beg & steal as well as doing whatever work they could find in order to eat.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

7
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
FALSE-ISH
Quite a lot of licence appears to have been taken here but the spirit of the scene is true & although it didn't happen, it's true that it didn't happen in Khandwa in 1986.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

8
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
TRUE-ISH
Nothing like this is reported as happening on this day, but it's the kind of thing that may have happened in general.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

9
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
FALSE
This is a creation of the filmmakers, designed to set up an important flashback for Saroo in 20 years' time. But it didn't happen.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

10
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
FALSE-ISH
Saroo actually describes what happened on this evening, & there was no illicit milk involved.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

11
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
FALSE-ISH
Something similar could have happened at some point but it definitely didn't happen today.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

12
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
TRUE
Saroo's mum did leave them alone — "perhaps to see if she could get us some more food", writes Saroo — & he was often responsible for his sister's welfare.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

13
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
TRUE
On this particular night, Guddu was leaving as he usually did, to go to a neighbouring town where he would look for work & usually sleep there. Unusually, Saroo did ask his brother if he could accompany him on this night.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

14
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
FALSE-ISH
Rather than argue with Saroo, Guddu "thought about it for a moment & then agreed".
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

15
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
FALSE
None of this happened. There was no argument.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

16
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:13,000
TRUE
Saroo remembered this ride vividly as it was the first time he had accompanied Guddu on such a ride at this time of night. He even recalls Guddu's friend shouting his name, as he felt proud to be out with his brother.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

17
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
TRUE
Saroo writes that the train pulled in noisily & they scuttled aboard & made themselves comfortable.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

18
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:29,000
TRUE-ISH
Although this is the kind of thing they will have done, there is no mention of it on this particular occasion in the book.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

19
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
TRUE
They did find an empty carriage & Saroo did fall asleep, but there is no mention of a coin.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

20
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
TRUE
Saroo did insist that he couldn't go on without a rest & he did lie down on a bench on the platform.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

21
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
TRUE
Guddu did leave him there & did say he would be back, but the jalebis thing is made up, & also Guddu wasn't on his way to lift bales. He spent most of his time in this town. This was a normal night for him. He told Saroo he had to do a few things.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

22
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,000
TRUE
It seems there was a little less exploration & calling out of his brother's name in reality, but Saroo did board the train, figuring it was the one that would take them back home & that Guddu would come back & find him on there. So he got on & went straight to sleep.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

23
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,000
TRUE-ISH
The train was not quite deserted in reality, & Saroo didn't call out for his brother. He just got on, found an empty carriage & went back to sleep.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

24
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:49,000
TRUE
After a second of feeling happy that he might be on his way home, this is exactly what happened.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

25
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,000
TRUE
He kept looking out of the window to see if he recognised anything but became increasingly scared. He writes: "I wept & slept & sometimes looked out of the window."
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

26
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,000
TRUE-ISH
Although there is no mention of this in Saroo's account, it's not unreasonable that something of this nature occurred.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2, 7

27
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
FALSE-ISH
Although he says the train occasionally stopped & he did shout for help, he also says "somehow no-one ever saw me".
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

28
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:55,000
TRUE-ISH
Saroo never wrote about a storm or an apple core, but he admits his memories of that journey were not great. He was convinced he'd only travelled for 12-15 hours, but in reality, it must've been nearer 30. So even though he was used to hunger, he must have looked for food.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

29
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
TRUE
Saroo watched out of the window as the train arrived in Calcutta (as it was then) & hundreds or thousands of people came into view on the platform.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

30
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:59,000
TRUE-ISH
He did leave the train when the door opened & he did start asking people for his home town, although there is no mention in the book of climbing anything or shouting for his family.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

31
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:49,000
FALSE
Nah, he never did any of this. What he did was more interesting but less cinematic. For a couple of weeks he tried to catch a train back home, so kept jumping trains to different places & ending up back in Calcutta. Poor little blighter.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

32
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
TRUE-ISH
More or less true. After a couple of weeks of living in the station & taking trains in the day, he slept close to a bunch of street kids he'd already seen quite a few times.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

33
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
FALSE
In reality "the children weren't welcoming" & he writes of one time he slept on "a hard wooden seat close to them".
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

34
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
TRUE
This scene is pretty much exactly as it is described in the book.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

35
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:23,000
TRUE-ISH
He ran straight down a platform (which is where they were in reality, rather than in a covered subway) & jumped off the end & onto the tracks.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

36
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,000
FALSE-ISH
There was no gate & no guard. Rather, Saroo ran off down the tracks.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

37
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
TRUE-ISH
Having jumped onto the train track, Saroo is almost hit by a train, flattening himself against a wall for a long time, the train being composed of many carriages. Much more exciting than a silly old bus.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

38
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:49,000
TRUE-ISH
Although it was very different to the one in the film, Saroo did come across a temple at one point. (Not on the night he was chased from the station though.) However, on that night he did come across some sleeping holy men on a riverbank.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

39
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:26,000
TRUE-ISH
Again, it didn't happen yet & when it did, it happened under a bridge & was on a much smaller scale, with pictures & little statues on wooden planks. (Plus the goddess was on a tiger, not a lion.) But he did eat the fruit. (And took coins.)
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

40
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
TRUE-ISH
On another occasion, he slept close to a shrine under a bridge & when he woke up, there was a holy man meditating. He was later joined by others. So it has the essence of truth.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

41
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:17,000
TRUE
He actually walked along the river bank for the first time the previous evening, the first night he'd left the station, after a couple of weeks being in Calcutta. & yes, he saw many things.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2

42
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:27,000
FALSE
This whole cardboard thing never happened in real life.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

43
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:01,000
TRUE
Cardboard aside, Saroo walked the streets for months & would often gravitate towards the tracks as they held for him the possibility of returning home.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

44
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
TRUE-ISH
One time Saroo was sitting on the railways tracks, a railway worker approached him & was kind to him.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

45
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:11,000
FALSE-ISH
This is a fictionalised version of what happened with the railway worker, but it's very far removed from the reality. He was actually taken to a shack next to the tracks. No kite.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

46
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:46,000
FALSE-ISH
Saroo actually stayed for three nights with the railway worker & his fellow workers in a shack made of corrugated iron & cardboard. There is no mention of dinner-time conversation however.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

47
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
FALSE
The reality of this meeting was a lot less glamorous. It wasn't set in an apartment & it didn't include anything as luxurious as fizzy orange.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

48
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:45,000
FALSE 
There was no Noor.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

49
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:28,000
TRUE-ISH
The railway man on whom Noor is based promised Saroo on his second day with him that he'd arranged for a man to visit & that this man would be able to help him.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

50
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:17,000
TRUE
The details are all wrong but the thrust is right. A man came & lay down with Saroo making lots of promises. Saroo played along but intuited that the man was bad news.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

51
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,000
FALSE-ISH
None of this is real. The relationship between Noor (who didn't exist) & Rama (who kind of did) didn't exist.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

52
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:22,000
FALSE 
None of this happened. All of this scene is totally made up.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

53
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:39,000
TRUE-ISH
Again, the details are invented, but something similar did happen. On his third night in the railway worker's shack, awaiting the return of the creepy man, Saroo made a run for it.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

54
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:53,000
TRUE-ISH
Saroo was chased by a couple of the railways workers & he hid in a sewerage pipe to get away from them.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

55
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
TRUE
Enough of this scene is true to mark it true. Saroo's mother did move rocks for a living, he almost certainly helped her at some stage, & he must have thought constantly about his mother as he slept rough in Calcutta.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch3

56
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:57,000
TRUE
Although he doesn't say exactly how long he was on the streets (probably because he doesn't know), a couple of months seems reasonable.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch2-4

57
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:06,000
FALSE-ISH
There is no mention of any of this in the book.  Though it is likely Saroo foraged extensively for food & valuables.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley

58
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
FALSE
A reference to the butterflies in the opening scene maybe, but a made-up one.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley

59
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:24,000
FALSE
The spoon thing appears in an early version of the script, but unfortunately, in real life, it never really happened.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley
Original script by Luke Davies

60
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:34,000
FALSE-ISH
Saroo saw lots of dead bodies during his time in Calcutta, which was very much more harrowing than is portrayed in the film, but he never writes about seeing a funeral.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley

61
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:51,000
FALSE
All of this stuff with the spoon is a way of enlivening a very simple meeting with the teenage boy who ends up taking Saroo to the police station.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

62
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
FALSE
This is a lovely little scene, but completely invented. He met the boy who took him to the police in the street. The boy was pushing a cart & just started talking to Saroo quite randomly. No spoon. No café.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

63
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:51,000
FALSE
Saroo never met a man in a café.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

64
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:24,000
TRUE-ISH
Saroo met a boy about his brother Guddu's age (15), who looked after him for a couple of days & then took him to the police. Once there, Saroo was unable to answer their questions.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

65
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
FALSE-ISH
In reality, Saroo was locked in a cell overnight, then taken to a building where "official-looking people" asked questions, filled in forms & declared him lost. His first photograph was taken a month later by the adoption agency. (Also, the date is wrong. It was April 21st.)
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4, 11

66
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,000
TRUE
Saroo was taken to a children's home & may have been given a haircut although it seems unlikely. The place was pretty brutal — much more so than is portrayed in the film.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

67
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:51,000
TRUE
Pretty much, but in reality, the dorms were much more packed & from the description in the book, it's unlikely Saroo ever had a bed of his own (or a clean white vest).
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

68
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:27,000
FALSE
Saroo doesn't mention any friends at Liluah (the juveline detention centre in question). Rather he mentions bullying & beatings from both children & staff.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

69
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:41,000
TRUE
Although the classroom part may not be true, Saroo writes that the centre was basically a dumping ground for mentally ill & disabled kids, as well as criminals, gang members & lost kids. A kid banging his head is very believable.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

70
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:04,000
TRUE-ISH
Although Saroo doesn't write about this exact incident, it seems likely he saw similar things.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

71
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:48,000
TRUE-ISH
All of the scenes in the detention centre are specific stories made up by the scriptwriter to convey the non-specific details conveyed in the book. There were, however, kids "acting crazily" & kids being abused.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

72
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:52,000
FALSE
Saroo makes no mention of a tender dead-of-night singalong & it doesn't seem likely in the kind of place he describes.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

73
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:11,000
TRUE
After a few weeks in Liluah, Saroo was moved to a much less brutal place, a pre-adoption orphanage called Nava Jeevan, where he met Mrs Sood.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

74
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:19,000
TRUE
ISSA, the adoption agency, published a photo of Saroo in two newspapers in June 1987, but recieved no response. Mrs Sood did explain this to Saroo.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

75
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:09,000
TRUE
This is near enough what happened, although it happened in a different place.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

76
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:48,000
TRUE
Saroo was actually given a "bewitching little red photograph album" rather than a single photo, & he writes of accepting that he wouldn't see his family again at this point surprisingly readily.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

77
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
FALSE-ISH
He writes of accepting that he wouldn't see his family again at this point surprisingly readily.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

78
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:44,000
TRUE-ISH
Saroo met a little girl in pre-adoption place on whom Amita is probably based. She was called Asra & was also up for adoption in Australia. Saroo & Asra shared some poignant moments preparing for their new lives.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

79
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:36,000
TRUE-ISH
The pre-adoption kids were taken to a nice house where a woman they were told to address as "Aunty Ula" taught them basic table manners but no English. Saroo writes: "I think I was taught to say 'Hello', but there was no time for more than that."
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

80
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:33,000
TRUE
There were actually 4 adoption officials & 8 kids in total but let's not split hairs. He did fly to Australia in a Tasmania T-shirt, which had been sent to the adoption agency by the Brierleys.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

81
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:32,000
TRUE-ISH
All of this happened as it did in the film, except there were 8 kids & various families & it happened in Melbourne. They had to take another flight to Hobart, but that was obviously deemed unnecessarily complicated for a cinema audience.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

82
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
TRUE
They actually stayed in a hotel in Melbourne for a night, then flew to Hobart, before driving home, but it did happen.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch5

83
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:03,000
TRUE
Saroo doesn't mention this happening exactly, but frankly, it must have happened on his first day in a new home so different to everything else he had known.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch5

84
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:39,000
FALSE
This refers back to the English lessons he never had at the orphanage that wasn't portrayed in the film. As such, it can't be said to have happened.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch4

85
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:30,000
TRUE
Again, although this isn't mentioned in the book, it seems only fair to surmise that scenes very close to this must have taken place.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley

86
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000

00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:39,000

Saroo was 10 by the time Mantosh arrived, so it was much longer than the "one year later" implied in the film. There is also no mention of the picture Saroo drew, but it seems reasonable that he will have drawn one.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch5

89
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:11,000
TRUE
Although Saroo doesn't write about meeting Mantosh at the airport, we know that Mantosh was affected by some horrific experiences, so this scene rings perfectly true.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch5

90
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:23,000
This is not known but seems reasonable. 
Again, this isn't mentioned in the book, but it seems perfectly reasonable.

Mantosh frequently acted out physically & had to be restrained.

92
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:31,000

This scene is not specifically recounted in the book but again, it must have happened. Saroo speaks of receiving much less attention once Mantosh arrived.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch5

93
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It may have happened. 
There is no mention of this in the book but it would be churlish to insist that it never happened, or indeed that it did.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley

94
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:59,000

Saroo grew up loving the water. He even loved it in India, before he could swim, which resulted in a couple of near-drownings in Calcutta.

95
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:24,000

Aside from the fact that Saroo went to Canberra rather than Melbourne, he makes no mention of Mantosh missing a goodbye lunch. It seems likely, however, that a goodbye lunch did take place.

96
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:46,000
May have happened, but is not recorded. 
Although there may well have been occasions such as this one, Saroo makes no mention of them, neither just before leaving to study, nor indeed ever.

98
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,000

Lucy, you will be sad to hear, is a totally fictitious love interest that scriptwriters apparently insist on. Saroo mentions having girlfriends, but none during the 18 months he spent in Canberra. We feel betrayed.

99
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:05,000
FALSE-ISH
Saroo doesn't dwell on his studies in Canberra, but we can assume that there was an introductory seminar at some point. But Lucy wasn't there.

100
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:24,000
TRUE-ISH
Although not specifically referenced, Saroo writes about studying with many international students of Indian origin, a fact that brought his ethnicity to the forefront & saw him talking about his past like never before.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

101
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:38,000

Saroo didn't really care for Lucy at all, mostly on account of her not existing.

102
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:16,000
FALSE
This is one of the few scenes in the film that actually rings as false as it is. It also seems like a pale imitation of the Spike Jonze short film "How They Get There".

103
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:32,000

There was no Saroo & Lucy. This relationship is not true.

104
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:04,000
TRUE
Although this particular party seems to be an imagined gathering, Saroo had a large social circle of Indian friends & became immersed in Indian culture as a result.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

105
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:23,000
FALSE
Something similar may have happened as Saroo became immersed in Indian culture for the first time, but his Mum & Dad saw that he & Mantosh ate a lot of Indian food growing up, so maybe not.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

106
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:12,000
FALSE
This is a beautiful scene full of swirling Proustian sensuousness as Saroo's past is conjured up by this heartbreaking sweetmeat. Sadly, it never happened. There is not a single mention of jalebis in the source material.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

107
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:43,000
FALSE
None of this happened. Not only was Lucy not real, but the real Saroo didn't seem to have the profound melancholia bubbling under the surface that is suggested in this scene.

108
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:57,000
FALSE-ISH
Saroo says simply that he became aware of Google Earth after moving to Canberra & beginning to think about finding his home. There must have been a first time he heard it mentioned, but if this scene had occurred in real life, he would surely have written about it.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

109
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:23,000

110
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:02,000

A little character development for a made-up character, but sadly, Lucy's mother is as fictitious as Lucy.

111
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:25,000

If Lucy had been real & had really asked him this question, it seems unlikely he would have been so unwilling to talk about it. But she wasn't. & she didn't.

113
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:55,000
TRUE-ISH
There will have been the first time he checked Google Earth & began his search, but Lucy wasn't there & he probably wasn't so miserable about it. Also, his first search was centred on two half-remembered place names rather than train speeds & search radii.

Saroo was aware of the enormity of his task & also aware that he had to concentrate on his studies, which he did, frequently forgetting about his search for months at a time.

117
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:41,000
TRUE-ISH
There is nothing in the book to suggest that this scene ever took place. Plus, let's not forget, Lucy wasn't real. However, it is true that Saroo kept his internet searching from his parents, not wanting to upset or worry them.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley

118
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:39,000

Saroo doesn't even hint at anything like this happening. Sadly, it smacks of sensationalism. Or if you prefer, filmmaking.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley

119
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:04,000

120
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:38,000
FALSE-ISH
The main problem with these scenes is that even when Saroo became properly obsessed, much much later back in Tasmania, it was a much more positive thing, an intellectual process of elimination rather than the lugubrious near-depression depicted in the film.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch8

121
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:03,000
FALSE
No, none of this happened. He wouldn't get obsessed for years yet, & even when he did, & even when he lived with a woman called Lisa (on whom Lucy must be partly based) he reports no destructive aloofness.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

122
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:58,000

All of this feels like the filmmakers are over-soap-operafying his life.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

123
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:15,000

There is no suggestion that Saroo's attitude toward his past was a destructive force in his relationships — certainly not in such an overt way as portrayed in these scenes.

124
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:02,000

None of this quite rings true and it certainly didn't happen in these circumstances. Neither does Saroo mention the wall maps looking like this, which he would have, if they did.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

125
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:23,000

01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:11,000

He talks about disheartening moments, but in reality, he didn't allow his search to overwhelm him or make him depressed. Rather, he talks about never forgetting his past, but never feeling that there was something missing, & never feeling that he couldn't enjoy his life.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch7

127
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:54,000
FALSE
This scene feels very made up & seems to exist just to ramp up Saroo's misery, which is not really real. It seems very unlikely also that he would be such a dick as to leave his dad outside talking to him through the door.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley

128
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:01,000

129
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:39,000

Having Lucy as a constant, from college days right through to when the search became an obsession, is a choice the filmmakers made, but life isn't like that. Or at least wasn't, in this particular case.

Sue may not have told Saroo about it at this point, but it's true that she had always wanted to adopt rather than add to the problem of overpopulation.

140
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:40,000

This happens in the film exactly as Saroo describes it in the book. Right down to Sue wondering if she was having a breakdown, & feeling a sense of something overwhelmingly good for the first time in her short life.
A Long Way Home (2013) by ‎Saroo Brierley, ch6

141
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:11,000

This is based on the idea that Saroo's obsession with his search and his refusal to tell his parents drovea bit of a wedge between them. This seems to have been invented by the filmmakers.

142
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:13,000

147
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:42,000

Shekila did arrive, with a husband & two sons that no one mentioned in the film. She arrived around the same time as Kallu, Saroo's other brother, the middle brother who the filmmakers chose to pretty much erase from history. (He is mentioned once, but not identified.)

On the first day any crowd-based celebration would have been outside his mum's house & perhaps rather limited. In reality, however, Saroo came back every day for four days, the media got involved & at one point, he writes, "the gathering turned into a public celebration".

Saroo did go back to his hotel in the evening & he did leave a message with his parents. Just not a voice message. Probably because it was the middle of the night there, he sent a text.
