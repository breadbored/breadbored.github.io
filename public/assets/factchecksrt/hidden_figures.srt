6
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
TRUE
Katherine's father moved the family 120 miles each school year so that the girls could attend the West Virginia Institute, since in their hometown of White Sulphur Springs blacks couldn't continue their education beyond 8th grade. Both parents were fully supportive & always there for her.
History vs. Hollywood

00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
FALSE
Katherine didn't commute with Mary & Dorothy, & the broken-down-car incident isn't in the book. Also Dorothy never learnt to drive & wasn't an engineer, so it's unlikely she could have fixed a car anyway.

12
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,000
TRUE
We don't have the details of this particular meeting, & some of these characters were composites. We do know there was enormous pressure on NASA from the administration to catch up with Russia.

13
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
TRUE
Langley got its first IBM machines in the mid-1950s, with several upgrades in the years following. Big hopes were pinned on those machines, but human computers were still vital.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch14

14
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:03,000
TRUE
Dorothy handed out assignments to the West computer room 'girls', where Katherine started out, although the department was dissolved in 1958. Katherine had left to join the Flight Research Division much earlier. Vivian was a representative character.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch6, 9

15
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,000
TRUE
This happened earlier on. West room supervisor Blanche Sponsler suffered a breakdown & was admitted to a sanitorium. Dorothy was appointed acting supervisor where she was kept in limbo for 2yrs, pushing for the title she wanted, until she was finally made supervisor in 1951.

18
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:49,000
TRUE-ISH
Czarnecki suggested Mary enroll in the engineer training program. He was a white Catholic yankee, not Jewish, but still, he didn't care for gender or race segregation & didn't see why it should hinder brainpower like Mary's.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch11

19
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:39,000
TRUE
Katherine was selected from the West computers to assist the Flight Research Division, which later morphed into the Space Task Group. She was the first black woman to join the team.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch12

20
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:44,000
TRUE-ISH
It wasn't all men like the movie shows, some women worked in the Flight Research Division (later the Space Task Group). Katherine was the only black woman, though, so she might have drawn a few looks.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch12

21
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:14,000
FALSE-ISH
Katherine worked through hundreds of pages of calcs daily. Stafford is a composite character, created to represent racist & sexist attitudes that were very real within parts of NASA at the time, although Katherine says she never experienced racism personally at NASA.
History vs. Hollywood

22
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000

24
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:42,000
TRUE-ISH
The book relates an incident where white women can't tell Mary where the black bathrooms are (they don't know), so she has to walk miles to find one by herself. Katherine refused to use black bathrooms from her first day on.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch11

25
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:33,000
TRUE-ISH
This scene illustrates a common issue but not one that Katherine experienced. The book relates an incident where Mary has to walk miles to use the black bathrooms.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch11, 13

26
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000

Katherine ignored bathroom segregation from day one, just using whichever was closest.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch11, 13

27
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:47,000
FALSE-ISH
The coffee incident isn't in the book & Katherine is on record saying she never personally experienced racism at Langley. However, catering facilities, bathrooms etc were segregated at Langley until NACA became NASA in 1958, so the scene is demonstrative.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch12

28
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000

Harrison wasn't a real person, but he's typical of perfectionist NASA directors. Katherine didn't work that closely with any of the directors, though.

29
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:36,000
FALSE-ISH
Mary, Dorothy & Katherine didn't commute together, although Katherine did commute with another black woman, Eunice Smith. Dorothy was supervisor already by this point, but it had taken her 2yrs to get the gig, so she likely complained at some point.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch8, 20

30
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:44,000
TRUE
Katherine did live with her mother at some point, whom she was close to, although it's unclear exactly when. She had three daughters with Jimmy Goble.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch8

31
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
TRUE
Katherine's first husband Jimmy Goble died around Christmas 1956. She raised her children alone until she remarried in 1959. Everybody was worried about the Russians by this point, it's likely the girls were concerned too.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch13

32
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:31,000
TRUE
Katherine did meet her future second husband in church, where he was introduced to the congregation by the pastor. He was an army captain, & she noticed him straight away.

We don't know much about Mary's relationship with her husband.


34
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:15,000
TRUE-ISH
The details of Katherine & Johnson's early courtship are kept to a minimum in the book. We know they attended church & lunches etc together, & they did meet at a church thing & began dating right away. Mary & Dorothy weren't involved, though.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch11

35
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:39,000
She was private about her private life. 
We don't know what was said between the two during their early courtship.


36
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:23,000
We couldn't find sources for this. 
NASA introduced the Mercury 7 in Washington in 1959, & they become overnight heroes. It's likely many NASA staff were super keen to greet them on arrival at Langley. We don't know whether or not Glenn insisted on meeting everyone, but it seems he was comfortable working with Katherine over the years.

There's no record of walls being smashed to fit an IBM in.
History vs. Hollywood

40
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:48,000

Dorothy was very interested in the IBM & took pains to find out as much about it as she could, eventually learning the Fortan programming needed to work it.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch14

41
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:58,000
TRUE
Katherine did play a huge part in Shepard's flight, calculating the trajectories for the capsule. Christened Freedom 7, the mission was a big success.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch20

42
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:10,000

43
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000

The canteens were segregated, but only until 1958, and Katherine usually took lunch alone at her desk anyway.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch14

44
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:29,000
TRUE
Mary did need to take an extension course to be able to apply for the engineer training program at NASA. The course was only available at Hampton High, a segregated school.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch14

45
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:05,000
TRUE-ISH
Mary was hugely frustrated by segregation & probably did rant about it to her friends, but she didn't spend much time with Katherine & Dorothy outside of work. She decides to petition the court for access to classes at Hampton.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly, ch14

46
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:04,000
FALSE-ISH
Although friendly, the three women weren't especially close. We're assuming they probably all baked & partied with their friends at some point.
Hidden Figures (2016) by Margot Lee Shetterly

47
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:32,000
TRUE-ISH
This moment isn't in the book, but the civil rights movement was in full swing at this stage – it's likely Dorothy & her family encountered protests in highly segregated Virginia in the 1960s.


48
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:16,000

This particular incident isn't on record, but libraries were indeed segregated, with the black sections having the poorest selection of texts.

She didn't steal a library book, but she was actively against segregation & it's likely she shared her views with her children.

50
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000

It was definitely game-on from 1961, when JFK told the world the US would put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. Harrison was a composite character, but we're assuming the real NASA directors took a similar stance.
History.com

60
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:41,000
TRUE
We don't know if the team applauded her, but since it was her boss Czarnecki who wanted her to join the training program that required court permission for her to get the relevant qualifications, we're assuming he was probably pleased about her success.

TRUE-ISH
There's no record of any such conversation, although we're assuming that there might have been uncomfortable moments like this following desegregation at Langley. It was a big change, especially considering segregation was still in force outside the gates.

Katherine accepted Johnson's marriage proposal, but we don't know much beyond that. It was years earlier, too.

It wasn't that simple. While the computers did replace the need for some human computing, the human computers continued to work alongside the computing machines, it wasn't one or the other.

Katherine wore pearls for her cover photo on the Pittsburgh Courier that year. We don't know who bought them, though, & her engagement was well before then.

01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:11,000
TRUE-ISH
Katherine was married for the second time slightly earlier, in 1959. She wasn't especially close to Mary or Dorothy, although she was inseparable from Eunice Smith, who also worked at NASA but didn't feature in the film, & who likely attended the wedding.

101
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:42,000
TRUE-ISH
The IBM numbers were fine, but Glenn trusted Katherine more than the machine, requested she checked them. It wasn't the last-minute rush shown in the movie though, it happened well before launch & Katherine spent a couple of days on the figures.

102
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:48,000
TRUE-ISH
Katherine checked the numbers while Glenn prepared for his mission, but it was within the week before his launch, not minutes before.

103
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:02,000
TRUE-ISH
It was Katherine who confirmed the numbers that would get Glenn back down from space, but it wasn't a last minute thing by any means. She spent a couple of days on it.

01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:44,000
TRUE-ISH
Dorothy was made supervisor much earlier. Dorothy was highly respected by everybody she worked with. She did work on the IBMs with her team after reinventing herself as a programmer at the age of 50.

108
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:32,000

A heat shield warning did appear. Glenn kept the rocket pack attached to keep the loose shield in place, but it didn't stick.

109
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:39,000

01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:38,000
TRUE
14 minutes after losing the rocket pack, Glenn's voice came back on the comms. He was fine. He landed safely in the sea where the Navy was ready to pick him up.

01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:15,000

Katherine wasn't in the room as far as we know. Her involvement in the success of the mission was recognised at NASA, though, & it was hoped & assumed that she'd be on board to work on the moon mission.

01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:05,000
TRUE
Mary & Dorothy represented huge advancements for black women through their contributions to the space program. Mary continued that work through the Langley women's program, which she managed. Dorothy was NASA's first black supervisor.

Katherine's calculations helped get the US to the moon, & she was responsible for the plan that saved Apollo 13 astronauts when the computers went out, among a long list of other achievements. She was awarded the country's highest honour in 2015.
